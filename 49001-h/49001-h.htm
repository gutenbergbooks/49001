<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>These are not new fairy-tales, the ones in this
book that has been newly made for you and placed
in your hands. They are old fairy-tales gathered
together, some from one country, and some from
another. They are old, old, old. As old as the
hills or the human race,—as old as truth itself.
Long ago, even so long ago as when your grandmother’s
grandmother’s grandmother was a little
rosy-cheeked girl, and your grandfather’s grandfather’s
grandfather was a noisy shouting little
boy, these stories were old.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>No one knows who first told them, nor where nor
when. Perhaps none of them was told by any one
particular person. Perhaps they just grew upon
the Tree of Wisdom when the world was young,
like shining fruit, and our wise and simple first
parents plucked them, and gave them to their
children to play with, and to taste. They could
not harm the children, these fruits from the tree of
wisdom, for each one was a lovely globe of truth,
rich and wholesome to the taste. Magic fruit,
for one could eat and eat, and still the fruit was
there as perfect as ever to be handed down through
generations, until at last it comes to you, as beautiful
as in those days of long ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps you did not know that fairy tales were
ever truths, but they are—the best and oldest of
them. That does not mean they are facts like the
things you see around you or learn from history
books. Facts and truths are as different as the
body and the spirit. Facts are like the body that
we can see and touch and measure; we cannot see
or measure the Spirit, but it is there.</p>

<p>We can think of these truths as of different
shapes and colors, like pears and apples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
plums and other fruits, each with a different
taste and color. But there is one great truth
that flows through them all, and you know very
well what it is:—evil in the end must always
defeat itself, and in the end good always triumphs.
The bad magician is tripped up by his own tricks,
and the true prince marries the princess and
inherits the kingdom. If any one of these stories
had told it otherwise, that story would have died
and withered away.</p>

<p>So take this book and read, being very sure that
only good will come to you however often you
read them over and over and over again.</p>

<h2>Mother’s Nursery Tales</h2>





<hr class="chap" />


<h2>THE SLEEPING BEAUTY</h2>


<p>There were once a King and Queen who had no
children, though they had been married for many
years. At last, however, a little daughter was born
to them, and this was a matter of great rejoicing
through all the kingdom.</p>

<p>When the time came for the little Princess to be
christened, a grand feast was prepared, and six
powerful fairies were asked to stand as her godmothers.
Unfortunately the Queen forgot to invite
the seventh fairy, who was the most powerful of
them all, and was also very wicked and malicious.</p>

<p>On the day of the christening the six good fairies
came early, in chariots drawn by butterflies, or by
doves or wrens or other birds. They were made
welcome by the King and Queen, and after some
talk they were led to the hall where the feast had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
been set out. Everything there was very magnificent.
There were delicious fruits and meats and
pastries and game and everything that could be
thought of. The dishes were all of gold, and for
each fairy there was a goblet cut from a single
precious stone. One was a diamond, one a sapphire,
one a ruby, one an emerald, one an amethyst,
and one a topaz. The fairies were delighted with
the beauty of everything. Even in their own fairy
palaces they had no such goblets as those the King
had had made for them.</p>

<p>They were just about to take their places at the
table when a great noise was heard outside on the
terrace. The Queen looked from the window and
almost fainted at the sight she saw. The bad fairy
had arrived. She had come uninvited, and the
Queen guessed that it was for no good that she
came. Her chariot was of black iron, and was
drawn by four dragons with flaming eyes and brass
scales. The fairy sprang from her chariot in haste,
and came tapping into the hall with her staff in her
hand.</p>

<p>“How is this? How is this?” she cried to the
Queen. “Here all my sisters have been invited to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
come and bring their gifts to the Princess, and I
alone have been forgotten.”</p>

<p>The Queen did not know what to answer. She
was frightened. However, she tried to hide her
fear, and made the seventh fairy as welcome as the
others. A place was set for her at the King’s right
hand, and he and the Queen tried to pretend they
had expected her to come. But for her there was
no precious goblet, and when she saw the ones that
had been given to the six other fairies her face grew
green with envy, and her eyes flashed fire. She
ate and drank, but she said never a word.</p>

<p>After the feast the little Princess was brought
into the room, and she smiled so sweetly and
looked so innocent that only a wicked heart could
have planned evil against her.</p>

<p>The first fairy took the child in her arms and
said, “My gift to the Princess shall be that of
contentment, for contentment is better than
gold.”</p>

<p>“Yet gold is good,” said the second fairy, “and
I will give her the gift of wealth.”</p>

<p>“Health shall be hers,” said the third, “for
wealth is of little use without it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I,” said the fourth, “will gift her with
beauty to win all hearts.”</p>

<p>“And wit to charm all ears,” said the fifth.
“That is my gift to her.”</p>

<p>The sixth fairy hesitated, and in that moment
the wicked one stepped forward. While the others
had spoken she had been swelling with spite like a
toad. “And I say,” cried she, “that in her seventeenth
year she shall prick her finger with a spindle
and fall dead.”</p>

<p>When the Queen heard this she shrieked aloud,
and the King grew as pale as death. But the sixth
fairy stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said she. “I have not spoken
yet. I cannot undo what our sister has done, but
I say that the Princess shall not really die. She
shall fall into a deep sleep that shall last a hundred
years, and all in the castle shall sleep with her. At
the end of that time she shall be awakened by a
kiss.”</p>

<p>When the wicked fairy heard this she was filled
with rage, but she had already spoken; she could
do no more. She rushed out of the castle and
jumped into her chariot, and the dragons carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
her away, and where she went no one either knew
nor cared.</p>

<p>The other fairies also went away, and they were
sad because of what was to happen to the Princess.</p>

<p>But at once the King gave orders that every
spinning-wheel and spindle in the land should be
destroyed, and when this was done he felt quite
happy again. For if all the spindles were gone the
Princess could not prick her finger with one; and
if she did not prick her finger she would not fall
into the enchanted sleep.</p>

<p>So the King and Queen were at peace, and all
went well in the castle for seventeen years. All
that the fairies had promised to the Princess came
true. She was so beautiful that she was the wonder
of all who saw her, and so witty and gentle-hearted
that everyone loved her. Beside this she had
health, wealth, and contentment, and was smiling
and joyous from morn till night.</p>

<p>One day the King and Queen went away on a
journey, and the Princess took it into her head to
mount to a high tower where she had never been
before, and to watch for their return from there.</p>

<p>She found the stairs that led to the tower, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
then she mounted them, up and up and up, until
she was high above the roofs of the castle. At last
she reached the very top of the tower, and there
was an iron door with a rusty key in it.</p>

<p>The Princess turned the key and the door swung
open. Beyond she saw a room, and an old, old,
wrinkled woman sat there at a wheel spinning.</p>

<p>The Princess had never seen a spinning-wheel
before. It seemed a curious thing to her. She
went in and stood close to the old woman so as to
see it better.</p>

<p>“What is that you are doing?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I am spinning,” answered the old woman.</p>

<p>“And what is that little thing that flies around so
fast?”</p>

<p>“That is a spindle.”</p>

<p>“It is a curious little thing,” said the Princess,
and she reached out her hand to touch it. Then
the point of the spindle pricked her finger, and at
once the Princess sighed, and her eyes closed, and
she sank back on a couch in a deep sleep.</p>

<p>Immediately a silence fell also upon all in the
castle. The King and Queen had just returned
from their journey; they had alighted from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
horses and had entered the castle, and just then
sleep fell upon them. The courtiers who followed
them also fell asleep. The dogs and horses in the
courtyard slept, and the pigeons on the eaves. The
boy who turned the spit in the kitchen slept and
the cook did not scold him, for she too was
asleep. The meat did not burn, for the fire was
sleeping. Even the flies in the castle and the
bees among the flowers hung motionless. All
slept.</p>

<p>Then all about the castle sprang up an enchanted
forest that shut it in like a wall. The forest grew
so dark and high that at last not even the top-most
tower of the castle could be seen.</p>

<p>But though the Princess slept she was not forgotten.
Many brave princes and heroes came and
tried to cut their way through the forest to rescue
her, but the boughs and branches were as hard as
iron, and moreover as fast as they were cut away
they grew again; also they were twisted so closely
together that no one could creep between them.
Then as years passed by, the brave heroes who had
sought the Princess grew old and had children of
their own. These, too, grew to be men and married,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and at last the Princess was forgotten by all,
or was remembered only as an old tale.</p>

<p>At last a hundred years had slipped away, and
then a young and handsome Prince came by that
way. He had been hunting, and he had ridden so
fast and eagerly that he had left his huntsmen far
behind. Now he was hot and weary, and seeing a
hut he stopped and asked for a drink of water.</p>

<p>The man who lived in the hut was very old.
He brought the water the Prince asked for, and
after the Prince had drank, he sat awhile and
looked about him. “What is that darkness, like
a cloud, that I see over yonder?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you for sure,” said the old man,
“for it is a long distance away and I have never
gone to see. But my grandfather told me once that
it was an enchanted forest. He said there was a
castle hidden deep in the midst of it, and that in
that castle lay a Princess asleep. That Princess,
so he said, was the most beautiful Princess in all
the world, but a spell had been laid on her, and she
was to sleep a hundred years. At the end of that
time a Prince was to come and waken her with a
kiss.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“And how long has she slept now?” asked the
Prince, and his heart beat in his breast like a bird.</p>

<p>“That I cannot say,” answered the old man,
“but a long, long time. My grandfather was an
old man when he told me, and he could not remember
her.”</p>

<p>The Prince thanked the old man for what he
had told him, and then he rode away toward the
enchanted forest, and he could not go fast enough,
he was in such haste.</p>

<p>When he was at a distance from the forest, it
looked like a dark cloud, but as he came nearer it
began to grow rosy. All the boughs and briers had
begun to bud. By the time he was close to them
they were in full flower, and when he reached the
edge of the forest the branches divided, leaving an
open path before him. Along this path the Prince
rode and before long he came to the palace. He
entered the courtyard and looked about him wondering.
The dogs lay sleeping in the sunshine and
never wakened at his coming. The horses stood
like statues. The guards slept leaning on their
arms.</p>

<p>The Prince dismounted and went on into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
palace; on he went through one room after another,
and no one woke to stop nor stay him. At last he
came to the stairway that led to the tower and he
went on up it,—up and up, as the Princess had
done before him. He reached the tower-room,
and then he stopped, and stood amazed. There
on the couch lay a maiden more beautiful than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
had ever dreamed of. He could scarcely believe
there was such beauty in the world. He looked and
looked and then he stooped and kissed her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">
<img src="images/i_b_010.jpg" width="372" height="331" alt="Sleeping Beauty awake with the Prince beside her" />
<div class="caption">THE SLEEPING BEAUTY</div>
</div>

<p>At once—on the moment—all through the
castle sounded the hum of waking life. The King
and Queen, down in the throne-room stirred and
rubbed their eyes. The guards started from sleep.
The horses stamped, the dogs sprang up barking.
The meat in the kitchen began to burn, and the
cook boxed the boy’s ears. The courtiers smiled
and bowed and simpered.</p>

<p>Up in the tower the Princess opened her eyes,
and as soon as she saw the Prince she loved him.
He took her hand and raised her from the couch.
“Will you be my own dear bride?” said he.
And the Princess answered yes.</p>

<p>And so they were married with great rejoicings,
and the six fairies came to the wedding and brought
with them gifts more beautiful than ever were seen
before. As for the seventh fairy, if she did not
burst with spite she may be living still. But the
Prince and Princess lived happily forever after.</p>

<h2>JACK AND THE BEAN-STALK</h2>


<p>Jack and his mother lived all alone in a little
hut with a garden in front of it, and they had nothing
else in the world but a cow named Blackey.</p>

<p>One time Blackey went dry; not a drop of milk
would she give. “See there now!” said the
mother. “If Blackey doesn’t give us milk we can’t
afford to keep her. You’ll have to take her off to
market, Jack, and sell her for what you can get.”</p>

<p>Jack was sorry that the little cow had to be sold,
but he put a halter around her neck and started off
with her.</p>

<p>He had not gone far, when he met a little old man
with a long gray beard.</p>

<p>“Well, Jack,” said the little old man, “where
are you taking Blackey this fine morning?”</p>

<p>Jack was surprised that the stranger should
know his name, and that of the cow, too, but he
answered politely, “Oh, I am taking her to market
to sell her.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no need for you to go as far as that,”
said the little old man, “for I will buy her from you
for a price.”</p>

<p>“What price would you give me?” asked Jack,
for he was a sharp lad.</p>

<p>“Oh, I will give you a handful of beans for her,”
said the old man.</p>

<p>“No, no,” Jack shook his head. “That would be
a fine bargain for you; but it is not beans but good
silver money that I want for my cow.”</p>

<p>“But wait till you see the beans,” said the old
man; and he drew out a handful of them from his
pocket. When Jack saw them his eyes sparkled,
for they were such beans as he had never seen
before. They were of all colors, red and green and
blue and purple and yellow, and they shone as
though they had been polished. But still Jack
shook his head. It was silver pieces his mother
wanted, not beans.</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you something further about
these beans,” said the man. “This is such a bargain
as you will never strike again; for these are
magic beans. If you plant them they will grow
right up to the sky in a single night, and you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
climb up there and look about you if you
like.”</p>

<p>When Jack heard that he changed his mind, for
he thought such beans as that were worth more
than a cow. He put Blackey’s halter in the old
man’s hand, and took the beans and tied them
up in his handkerchief and ran home with them.</p>

<p>His mother was surprised to see him back from
market so soon.</p>

<p>“Well, and have you sold Blackey?” she asked.</p>

<p>Yes, Jack had sold her.</p>

<p>“And what price did you get for her?”</p>

<p>Oh, he got a good price.</p>

<p>“But how much? How much? Twenty-five
dollars? Or twenty? Or even ten?”</p>

<p>Oh, Jack had done better than that. He had
sold her to an old man down there at the turn of the
road for a whole handful of magic beans; and then
Jack hastened to untie his handkerchief and show
the beans to his mother.</p>

<p>But when the widow heard he had sold the cow
for beans she was ready to cry for anger. She did
not care how pretty they were, and as to their being
magic beans she knew better than to believe that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
She gave Jack such a box on the ears that his head
rang with it, and sent him up to bed without his
supper, and the beans she threw out of the window.</p>

<p>The next morning when Jack awoke he did not
know what had happened. All of the room was
dim and shady and green, and there was no sky
to be seen from the window,—only greenness.</p>

<p>He slipped from bed and looked out, and then he
saw that one of the magic beans had taken root
in the night and grown and grown until it had
grown right up to the sky. Jack leaned out of the
window and looked up and he could not see the top
of the vine, but the bean-stalk was stout enough
to bear him, so he stepped out onto it and began
to climb.</p>

<p>He climbed and he climbed until he was high
above the roof-top and high above the trees. He
climbed till he could hardly see the garden down
below, and the birds wheeled about him and the
wind swayed the bean-stalk. He climbed so high
that after awhile he came to the sky country, and
it was not blue and hollow as it looks to us down
here below. It was a land of flat green meadows
and trees and streams, and Jack saw a road before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
him that led straight across the meadows to a great
tall gray castle.</p>

<p>Jack set his feet in the road and began to walk
toward the castle.</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he met a lovely lady,
and she was a fairy, though Jack did not know it.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Jack?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m going to yonder castle to have a look at
it,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the lady, “only you must
be careful how you poke about there, for that castle
belongs to a very fierce and rich and terrible giant:
and now I will tell you something: all the riches
he has used to belong to your father; the giant
stole them from him, so if you can fetch anything
away with you it will be a right and fair thing.”</p>

<p>Jack thanked her for what she told him, and
then he went on, setting one foot before the
other.</p>

<p>After awhile he came to the castle, and there
was a woman sweeping the steps, and she was
the giant’s wife.</p>

<p>When she saw Jack she looked frightened.
“What do you want here?” she cried. “Be off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with you before my husband comes home, for if he
finds you here it will be the worse for you I can tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know”; said Jack, “but I’ve had
no breakfast, and I’m like to drop I’m so hungry.
Just give me a bite to stay my stomach and I’ll
be off.” The giant’s wife did not want to do
that at all, but Jack begged and coaxed until at
last she let him come into the house and got out a
bit of bread and cheese for him.</p>

<p>Jack had hardly set down to it when there was
a great noise and stamping outside.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” cried the giant’s wife, and she
turned quite pale. “There’s my husband coming
in, and if he sees you here he’ll swallow you
down in a trice, and give me a beating into the
bargain.”</p>

<p>When Jack heard that he did not like it at all.
“Can you not hide me some place?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Here, creep into this copper pot,” cried the
woman, taking off the lid. She helped Jack into
the pot and put the lid over him, and she had no
more than done it before the giant came stumping
into the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fee, fi, fo, fum!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I smell the blood of an Englishman!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>he roared.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Be he alive or be he dead</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“What nonsense!” said his wife. “If anyone
had come here don’t you suppose I would have seen
him? A crow flew over the roof and dropped a
bone down the chimney, and that is what you
smell.”</p>

<p>When she said that the giant believed her.
He sat down at the table and called for breakfast.
The woman set before him three whole roasted
oxen and two loaves of bread each as big as a
hogshead, and the giant ate them up in a twinkling.</p>

<p>“Now, wife, bring me my moneybags from the
treasure-room,” he said.</p>

<p>His wife went out through a great door studded
with nails, and when she came back she brought
two bags with her and set them on the table in
front of the giant. The giant untied the strings
and opened them, and they were full of clinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
golden money. The giant sat there and counted
and counted the money. After it was all counted
he put it back in the bags again, and then he
stretched his legs out in front of him and went to
sleep and snored until the rafters shook.</p>

<p>The giant’s wife worked around for awhile and
then she went into another room. Jack waited
until he was sure she had gone, and then he pushed
the lid of the pot aside and crept out. He crept
over to the table and seized hold of the moneybags
and made off with them, and neither the giant
nor his wife knew anything about it until Jack was
safe down the bean-stalk and home again.</p>

<p>When Jack’s mother saw the moneybags she
was filled with wonder and joy. “Those were once
your father’s,” said she, “but they were stolen
from him, and never did I think to see them again.”</p>

<p>After that Jack and his mother lived well, they
had plenty to eat and drink, and good clothes to
wear, and everything they wanted. And they
were not stingy; they shared their good luck with
their neighbors as well.</p>

<p>After awhile the money was almost gone. “I’ll
just climb up the bean-stalk again,” said Jack to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
himself, “and see what else the giant has in his
castle.”</p>

<p>He climbed and he climbed and he climbed,
and after awhile he came to the giant’s country,
and there in front of him lay the road to the castle.
Jack walked along briskly, setting one foot in front
of the other till he came to the castle door, and as
he saw no one he opened the door and stepped
inside.</p>

<p>There was the giant’s wife scouring the pots and
pans, and when she saw Jack she almost dropped
the skillet she was holding.</p>

<p>“You here again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, here I am again,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Then I wish you were some place else,” said
the giant’s wife; “when you were here before our
moneybags were stolen, and I can’t help thinking
you had something to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! How can you think that?” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, be off with you, anyway”; and the giant’s
wife spoke quite glumly. “I want no more strange
lads around here.”</p>

<p>Yes, Jack would be off in a moment, but wouldn’t
she give him a bite of breakfast first?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>No, the giant’s wife wouldn’t, and that was flat.</p>

<p>But Jack was not to be turned off so easily; he
talked and begged and argued, and while he was
still talking they heard the giant at the door.</p>

<p>The giant’s wife was terribly scared, “Oh, if he
finds you here won’t I get a beating!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Quick; into the pot again!”</p>

<p>Jack crawled into the copper pot and the giant’s
wife put the lid over him.</p>

<p>The next moment the giant stamped into the
room.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fee, fi, fo, fum,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>he bawled,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I smell the blood of an Englishman;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Be he alive or be he dead,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“Nonsense,” said his wife, “you’re always
fancying things. Here, sit down at the table and
eat your breakfast. A crow flew over the roof and
dropped a bone in the fire, and that is what you
smell.”</p>

<p>The giant sniffed about a bit, and then, still
muttering to himself, he sat down at the table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
began to eat. After he had finished he cried,
“Now wife, bring me my little red hen from the
treasure-room.”</p>

<p>His wife went into the treasure-room, and presently
she came back with a little red hen in her
apron. She set it on the table before the giant.
The giant grinned till he showed all his teeth.</p>

<p>“My little red hen, my pretty red hen, lay,”
said the giant.</p>

<p>As soon as he said that the hen laid an egg all of
pure gold.</p>

<p>“My little red hen, my pretty red hen, lay!”
said the giant. Then the little red hen laid another
egg.</p>

<p>“My little red hen, my pretty red hen, lay,”
said the giant. Then the hen laid a third egg.</p>

<p>“There!” said the giant, “that is enough for
to-day. Now, wife, you can take her back to the
treasure-room again.”</p>

<p>His wife took up the hen and carried her off to
the treasure-room, but when she came back into
the kitchen she forgot to shut the treasure-room
door behind her.</p>

<p>Then the giant stretched his legs out in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
him and went to sleep and snored till the rafters
shook.</p>

<p>His wife worked around in the kitchen, and after
awhile, when she wasn’t looking, Jack crept out
of the pot. He crept over to the door of the treasure-room
and slipped through, and there was the
little red hen sitting comfortably on a golden nest.</p>

<p>Jack caught her up under his arm and she never
made a sound. Then he crept back through the
kitchen and out through the door, and made off
down the road, and the giant’s wife never saw him
at all.</p>

<p>But just as Jack reached the bean-stalk the hen
began to cackle. This woke the giant. “Wife,
wife,” he roared, “someone is stealing my little red
hen,” and he ran out of the castle and looked all
about him; but he could see no one, for Jack was
already half-way down the bean-stalk.</p>

<p>After that Jack and his mother never had any
lack of anything, for whenever he wanted money he
had only to say, “My little red hen, my pretty red
hen, lay,” and the hen would lay a gold egg.</p>

<p>Still Jack was not satisfied. He wanted to see
what else was in the giant’s castle. So one day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
without saying a word to his mother, he climbed the
bean-stalk and hurried along the road to the giant’s
castle. He did not want to meet the giant’s wife,
for he thought maybe she had guessed that it was
he who had taken the giant’s hen, and the moneybags,
and so indeed she had, and what was more
she had told the giant all about it, too.</p>

<p>Jack crept up to the castle very carefully, and he
saw no one. He opened the castle door a crack
and peeped in, and still he saw no one. He pushed
it open a little wider and then he ran in and across
the kitchen and hid himself in the great oven.</p>

<p>He had no more than done this before the giant’s
wife came in. “Pfu!” said she. “What a
draft!” and she closed the outside door. Then
she set the giant’s breakfast on the table, still
talking to herself. “The door must have blown
open,” said she. “I’m sure I closed it when I
went out.”</p>

<p>Presently the giant came thumping and stumping
into the house. The moment he entered the
room he began to bawl—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fee, fi, fo, fum!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I smell the blood of an Englishman;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Be he alive or be he dead,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I’ll grind his bones to make my bread.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“What? What?” cried his wife, “I found the
door open just now. Do you suppose that dratted
boy is in the house again?”</p>

<p>“If he is, I’ll soon put an end to him,” said
the giant.</p>

<p>The giant’s wife ran to the copper pot and
lifted the lid, and looked inside it, but no one was
there. Then she and the giant began to hunt
about. They looked in the cupboards and behind
the doors, and every place, but they never thought
of looking in the oven.</p>

<p>“He can’t be here after all,” said the wife, “or
we would have found him. It must be something
else you smell.”</p>

<p>So the giant sat down and began to eat his breakfast,
but as he ate he mumbled and grumbled to
himself.</p>

<p>After he had finished he said, “Wife, bring out
my golden harp to sing for me.”</p>

<p>His wife went into the treasure-room and came
back carrying a golden harp. She set it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
table before the giant and at once it began to make
music, and the music was so beautiful that it
melted the heart to hear it. The giant’s wife sat
down to listen, too, and presently the music put
them both to sleep. Then Jack crept out of the
oven and seized the harp and made off with it.</p>

<p>At once the harp began to call, “Master! master!
help! Someone is running off with me!”</p>

<p>The giant started out of sleep and looked about
him. When he found the harp gone he gave a
roar like an angry bull. He ran to the door and
there was Jack already more than half-way down
the road. “Stop! stop!” cried the giant, but Jack
had no idea of stopping. He ran until he reached
the bean-stalk, and then he began climbing down it
as fast as he could, still carrying the harp.</p>

<p>The giant followed and when he came to the
bean-stalk he looked down, and there was Jack
far, far below him. The giant was not used to
climbing. He did not know whether to follow or
not. Then the harp cried again, “Help, master,
help!” The giant hesitated no longer. He caught
hold of the bean-stalk and began to climb down.</p>

<p>By this time Jack had reached the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
“Quick! quick, mother!” he cried. “Bring me
an ax.”</p>

<p>His mother came running with an ax. She did
not know what he wanted it for, but she knew he
was in a hurry.</p>

<p>Jack seized the ax and began to chop the bean-stalk.
The giant above felt the stalk tremble.
“Wait! wait a bit!” he cried, “I want to talk to
you!”</p>

<p>But before he could say anything more the bean-stalk
was chopped through and fell with a mighty
crash, and as the giant fell with it that was the end
of him.</p>

<p>But Jack and his mother lived in peace and
plenty forever after.</p>

<h2>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h2>


<p>There was once a merchant who had three
daughters. The two older ones were handsome
enough, but the third was a beauty, and no mistake;
her eyes were as blue as the sky, her hair was as
black as ebony, and her cheeks were like roses.
The merchant loved his two older daughters dearly,
but this Beauty was the darling of his heart.</p>

<p>Things went along pleasantly for a long time,
and the merchant was rich and prosperous, but
then things began to go wrong with him. One
after another of his ships was lost at sea, and a
great part of his fortune with them.</p>

<p>One day the merchant called his daughters to
him and said, “My children, I find it will be necessary
for me to go on a long journey. I am no longer
a rich man, but I wish to bring home a gift to each
one of you, so tell me what you would like to have.”</p>

<p>Then the two older daughters began to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
all the things they wanted, and each was afraid the
other would get something finer than she did.</p>

<p>At last the eldest spoke, “Dear father,” said
she, “I wish you would bring me a velvet robe
embroidered with gold, and shoes to match, and a
fan to wave in my hand.”</p>

<p>“And I,” said the second, “would like a necklace
of pearls, and pearls for my hair, and a fine
bracelet.”</p>

<p>The merchant was troubled that his daughters
should ask for such costly things, but he did not
like to refuse them. “And you, Beauty,” said he,
turning to his youngest daughter, “what will you
have?”</p>

<p>“Dear father,” said she, “you have given me so
much that I have nothing left to wish for; but if you
bring me anything at all let it be a rose.”</p>

<p>When her older sisters heard this they were very
angry. They thought that Beauty had asked only
for a rose so that she might shame them before
their father, and make him think she was more
unselfish than they were. But Beauty had had no
such thought as that.</p>

<p>The merchant smiled at his youngest daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and kissed her thrice, but his older daughters he
kissed only once. Then he mounted his horse and
rode away.</p>

<p>He journeyed on for several days, and at last he
reached the city he was bound for. Here he found
he had lost even more of his fortune than he had
thought. He was now a poor man. Still he managed
to buy the gifts his two older daughters had
asked for, and then with a sad heart he set out for
home.</p>

<p>He had not journeyed far, however, when he
was overtaken by a storm and lost himself in a
deep forest. He rode this way and that, trying to
find the way out, and then suddenly he came to an
open place, and there he saw before him a magnificent
castle.</p>

<p>The merchant was amazed. He had never
heard of such a castle in that forest. He rode up
to the door and knocked, hoping to find shelter
for the night.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he knocked when the great door
swung open before him. He entered and looked
about, no one was there; everything was silent.
Wondering he went on into one room after another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Everything was very magnificent and well arranged,
but nowhere was a soul to be seen.
At last he came to a room where a supper was
set out. The plates were all of gold, and the
fruits and meats were of the rarest and most delicious
kinds.</p>

<p>The merchant was so hungry that he sat down at
the table, and at once the food was served to him
by invisible hands, while soft music sounded from
a hidden room beyond.</p>

<p>He ate heartily and then arose and went in
search of a place to sleep. This he soon found.
A bed had been made ready in a large chamber,
and here he undressed and lying down he slept
until morning without being disturbed.</p>

<p>When he awoke he found his own travel-stained
clothes had been taken away. In their place a
handsome suit had been laid out, and other necessary
things, all of the richest kind. There was also
a bag filled with gold pieces. Wondering still
more, the merchant arose and dressed and went
out into the gardens to look about him. Here
everything was more beautiful than any garden he
had ever seen before. There were winding paths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and fountains, and fruit-trees and flowering
plants.</p>

<p>Beside one of the fountains was a rose-bush
covered with the roses. The sight of these roses
reminded the merchant of Beauty’s wish, and he
thought it would be no harm to break off one to
carry to her. He chose the largest and finest rose.
Scarcely had he plucked it, however, when the
air was filled with a sound of thunder, the ground
rocked under his feet, and a terrible looking beast
appeared before him.</p>

<p>“Miserable man!” cried the Beast, “what
have you done? All the best in the castle was
offered to you. Why have you broken my rose-bush
that is dearer to me than anything in the
world? Now for this you must surely die.”</p>

<p>The merchant was terrified. “Oh, dear, good
Beast do not kill me!” he cried. “I meant no
harm. Only let me go, and I will never trouble
you again.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered the Beast. “You shall
not escape so easily. You have broken my rose-bush
and you must suffer for it.”</p>

<p>Still the merchant begged and entreated to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
spared and at last the Beast had pity on him.
“If I spare your life,” said he, “what will you
give me in return for it?”</p>

<p>“Alas,” said the merchant, “what can I give
you? I have lost all my fortune and I am now a
poor man. I have nothing left in the world but
my three daughters.”</p>

<p>“Give me one of your daughters for a wife and
I will be satisfied,” said the Beast.</p>

<p>The merchant was horrified at the thought of
such a thing. He would have refused, but he
feared that if he did so the Beast would tear him
to pieces at once.</p>

<p>“You may have three months in which to think
it over,” said the Beast. “But you must promise
me that at the end of that time you will return
here and either bring me one of your daughters
or come prepared to die.”</p>

<p>The merchant was obliged to promise this; he
could not help himself. As soon as he had promised
the Beast disappeared and the man was
free to go, and this he was not slow to do.</p>

<p>He rode on toward his home and his heart was
heavy within him. He did not see how he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
possibly give one of his daughters to be the bride
of a hideous beast and yet he did not wish to die.</p>

<p>His daughters met him with joy, and the two
older sisters were delighted when they saw the
beautiful gifts he had brought them. Only Beauty
noticed his sad and downcast looks.</p>

<p>“Dear father,” said she, “why are you
troubled? Has something unfortunate happened
to you?”</p>

<p>At first her father would not tell her, but she
urged and entreated him to tell her until finally
he could keep silence no longer. He told his
daughters all about the castle and his adventure
there and of the Beast, and of how unless one of
them would consent to marry the Beast he would
have to lose his life.</p>

<p>When the older daughters heard this they were
ready to faint. Not even to save their father’s
life could they consent to marry such a creature.</p>

<p>“Dear father,” said Beauty, “you shall not
die. I will be the Beast’s bride.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried her sisters. “That is only
right. If Beauty had not asked for the rose this
misfortune would not have happened.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>To this the merchant would not at first agree.
Beauty was the dearest to him of all his daughters.
He had hoped that if any of them was to marry the
Beast it might be one of the older sisters. But
they would not hear of this and when, at the end of
three months, the merchant set out to return to the
castle he took Beauty with him.</p>

<p>They rode along and rode along and after awhile
they came to the forest, and then it did not take the
merchant long to find the castle. He knocked at
the door, and it opened as before, and he and
Beauty went in through one room after another,
and everything was so magnificent that she could
not but admire it. At last they came to the supper-room,
and here a delicious feast was set out for
them. They sat down and ate while soft music
sounded around them. Beauty began to think the
master of all this could not be such a terrible creature
after all.</p>

<p>But scarcely had they finished their supper before
the Beast appeared before them, and when
Beauty saw him she began to shake and tremble,
for he was even more dreadful looking than her
father had said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do not fear me, Beauty,” he said in a gentle
voice. “I will do you no harm. Your father has
brought you here, and it is true that here you must
stay, but you need not marry me unless you are
quite willing to.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to marry you, Beast, and you must
know that,” said Beauty. “But I fear that if I
do not you may harm my father.”</p>

<p>“No, Beauty, I will not harm him. He may go
in peace, and perhaps after you have been here
awhile you may learn to like me enough to marry
me.”</p>

<p>Beauty did not believe this, but the Beast spoke
so gently that she no longer feared him and when
the time came for her father to go she bade him
good-by and did not grieve him by weeping.</p>

<p>After that Beauty lived there in the Beast’s castle
and was well content. Every day she went out
into the gardens, and the Beast came and played
with her for awhile, and she grew very fond of him.
Every day before he left her he said, “Beauty, are
you willing to marry me?”</p>

<p>But always Beauty answered, “No, dear Beast,
I do not wish to marry you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Beast would sigh heavily and go away.</p>

<p>One day Beauty was sitting before a large mirror
in her room, and she was sad because she had not
seen her father for so long.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said she, “that I could see what my
dear father is doing at this moment.”</p>

<p>As she said this she raised her eyes to the
mirror. What was her surprise to see in it the
reflection of a room quite different from the one
she was in. It was a room in her own home that
she saw reflected there. She saw in it the images
of her father and sisters. She could see them
smile and move, and she could tell exactly what
they were doing. She found she could watch
them in the mirror for as long as she pleased and
whenever she pleased.</p>

<p>After this Beauty often came to sit before the
mirror, and she had only to wish it and she could
see her home, and all that was going on there.</p>

<p>But one day when she sat down before the glass
she saw that her father was ill. He lay upon his
bed so pale and weak that Beauty was terrified.
She jumped up and ran out into the garden calling
for the Beast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>At once he appeared before her. “What is it?”
asked the Beast anxiously. “What has frightened
you, Beauty?”</p>

<p>“Alas,” she cried, “my father is ill. Oh, dear,
kind Beast let me go to him I pray, and I will love
you for ever after.”</p>

<p>The Beast looked very grave. “Very well,
Beauty,” he said, “I will let you go, for I can refuse
you nothing. But promise me you will return
at the end of a week, for if you do not some
great misfortune will happen to me.”</p>

<p>Beauty was very willing to promise this. The
Beast then gave her a ring set with a large ruby.
“When you go to bed to-night,” he said, “turn
the ruby in toward the palm of your hand and wish
you were in your father’s house, and in the morning
you will find you are there. When you are ready
to return do the same thing, and you will find yourself
back in the castle again. And do not forget
that by the end of a week, to an hour, you must
return or you will bring suffering upon me.”</p>

<p>Beauty did as the Beast told her. That night
when she lay down she turned the ruby of the
ring in toward the palm of her hand and wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
she were in her father’s house, and what was her
joy, when she awakened the next morning, to
find herself in her own bed at home. She arose
and ran to her father’s room, and the merchant was
so delighted to see her that from that hour he began
to get better, and in a few days he was as well as
ever again.</p>

<p>Beauty’s sisters asked her a great many questions
about the castle where she lived, and when
they heard how fine it was, and how happy she was
there, they were filled with envy. “Beauty always
gets the best of everything,” they said to each
other. “She is younger than either of us, and see
how finely she lives; much better than we do.”
They then planned together as to how they could
keep Beauty from going back to the castle at the
end of the week. “If we can only make her break
her promise to the Beast,” said they, “he might
be so angry with her that he would send her away
and take one of us to live at his castle instead.”</p>

<p>The day before Beauty was to return to the Beast
they put a sleeping-powder in the goblet that she
drank from.</p>

<p>As soon as Beauty had swallowed this powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
she became very sleepy. Her eyelids weighed
like lead, and presently she fell into a deep slumber,
and she did not awaken for two days and
nights. At the end of that time Beauty had a
dream, and in her dream she walked in the castle
gardens. She came to the rose-bush beside the
fountain, and there lay the poor Beast stretched out
on the ground, and he was almost dead. He opened
his eyes and looked at her sadly. “Ah, Beauty,
Beauty,” he said, “why did you break your promise
to return at the end of a week? See what
suffering you have brought on me.”</p>

<p>Beauty awoke, sobbing bitterly. “Alas, alas!”
she cried. “I must go at once. I feel some harm
has come to the Beast, and that it is my fault,
though how I do not know.” For she did not
know she had been asleep for two days and nights.</p>

<p>She turned the ruby ring with the ruby toward
the palm of her hand, and wished herself back in
the castle and then lay down and went to sleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke she was in the castle again, and
it was early morning. She ran out into the garden,
and straight to the rose-bush. There, as in her
dream, she saw the Beast stretched out on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
ground, and he seemed to be without life or
breath. Beauty threw herself down on the ground
and took his head in her lap, and her tears ran
down and fell upon him, and it seemed to her she
did not love even her father as dearly as she loved
the Beast. “Oh, Beast—dear, dear Beast,” she
cried, “can you not hear me? Are you quite,
quite dead?”</p>

<p>Then the Beast opened his eyes and looked at
her. “Ah, Beauty,” he said, “I thought you had
deserted me. Do you not yet love me enough to
marry me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do! I do love you enough, and gladly will
I be your bride,” cried Beauty.</p>

<p>No sooner had she said this than the rough furry
hide of the Beast fell apart, and a handsome young
prince all dressed in white satin and silver stood
before her. Beauty looked at him wondering.
“Yes, you shall indeed be my own dear bride,”
cried the Prince, “for you and you alone have
broken the enchantment that held me.”</p>

<p>Then the Prince, a Beast no longer, told Beauty
that a wicked fairy had changed him into the shape
of a Beast, and not until a fair young maiden would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
love him enough to be his bride would the enchantment
be broken. But Beauty had loved him
for his kindness and goodness in spite of his ugly
form, and now never again could the wicked fairy
have any power over him.</p>

<p>And now all through the castle was heard a
sound of life and of voices and of running to
and fro. For the same enchantment that had
changed the Prince to a Beast had made all his
people invisible, and now, they too were freed from
the spell.</p>

<p>Then how happy Beauty was. If she had loved
the Beast she loved the handsome young Prince
a thousand times better. A grand wedding feast
was prepared, and her father and sisters were sent
for. Her father was given the place of honor, but
it was quite different with her sisters; because of
their hard hearts they were changed into two statues
and they stood one on either side of the doorway.</p>

<p>But Beauty was too gentle to bear them any ill-will.
After she was married she often used to go
and stand beside the statues and talk to them, and
her tears fell upon them so that after awhile their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hard hearts grew soft and the stone melted back
to flesh again. Then they were all very happy together.
The two sisters were married to two
noblemen of the court.</p>

<p>As for Beauty and the Prince, nothing could
equal their love for each other, and they lived
together happy forever after, and no further harm
ever came to them.</p>

<h2>JACK-THE-GIANT-KILLER</h2>


<p>There was once a stout Cornish lad named Jack
who had trained himself in every sort of sport.
He could wrestle and throw and swim better than
any other lad in the country; indeed there were
few, even among the men, who could equal him in
strength and skill.</p>

<p>At that time there lived, on an island just off
the coast of Cornwall, a giant named Cormoran.
This giant was the pest of the whole land. He was
twenty feet high, and as broad as any three men.
People were so afraid of him that when he waded
over from his island to the mainland they all ran
and hid in their houses, and then he carried off
their flocks and herds as he chose, and asked no
leave of anyone. Seven sheep he ate at a meal,
and three oxen were not too much for him. There
was much complaining through the land because
of the way he wasted it.</p>

<p>Now Jack was as bold as he was strong, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
made up his mind to free the people from this
scourge of a giant. He waited for a dark night
when there was no moon, and then he swam from
the mainland over to the island. The waves were
high and the water cold, but Jack paid no heed to
that. He took with him a pick, a shovel, an ax,
and a horn.</p>

<p>As soon as he landed on the island he set to
work to dig a pit in front of the giant’s cave—a
pit both wide and deep. The giant was asleep,
for Jack could hear him snoring in his cave, and so
he knew nothing of what was being done by the
brave lad.</p>

<p>Toward morning the pit was finished. Then
Jack covered it over with branches, and scattered
earth and stones over it so that no one could have
told it was any different from the ground around it.
After that he took his horn and blew a blast both
loud and long.</p>

<p>The sound awakened the giant from his sleep,
and he sprang to his feet and came stumbling out
from his cave. He glared about him and presently
his eyes fell upon Jack.</p>

<p>“Miserable dwarf!” he cried. “Is it you who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
has dared to disturb my sleep? Wait but a moment
until I have my hands on you, and I will
punish you as you deserve!”</p>

<p>Jack laughed aloud. “I fear you not!” he
cried. “And as for punishing me, you will find
that easier said than done.”</p>

<p>The giant gave a cry of rage and sprang toward
Jack, but no sooner did he step upon the branches
that covered the pit than they gave way beneath
him, and he fell down into the pit and broke his
neck. There he lay without sound or motion, and
seeing that he was dead Jack left him where he
lay and swam back to the mainland.</p>

<p>When the people learned that the giant was dead
and would trouble them no more they went wild
with joy. Jack was hailed as a hero and a belt
was given him on which were letters of gold that
read—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is the gallant Cornishman</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who killed the giant Cormoran.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">And now the lad was no longer called plain Jack,
but Jack-the-Giant-Killer.</p>

<p>Now many miles away in a deep forest there lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
still another giant named Blunderbore. This giant
was full as strong and great as Cormoran had ever
been.</p>

<p>When Blunderbore heard how the Cornish lad
had killed Cormoran, and that now he was called
“Jack-the-Giant-Killer” he was filled with rage.
He swore he would find Jack and destroy him
even as Cormoran had been destroyed.</p>

<p>But Jack was no whit afraid. He had made up
his mind to altogether free the land from giants;
and he wished nothing better than to try his wits
with Blunderbore. So one day he took a stout
oak in his hand and set out in search of the giant.</p>

<p>He walked along and walked along, and after
awhile he came to a forest, and there a cool spring
bubbled up in the shade of the trees.</p>

<p>Jack was hungry and thirsty, and tired too, so he
sat him down by the spring and ate the bread and
cheese he carried, and drank of the fresh water,
and then he stretched himself out and went fast
asleep.</p>

<p>He had not been long asleep when the giant
Blunderbore came by that way. Blunderbore was
very much surprised to see a youth lying there and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sleeping quietly beside his fountain, for none ever
before had dared to venture here into this forest
for fear of him.</p>

<p>He saw a glitter of golden letters upon a belt
the lad wore, and stooping he read the words—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“This is the gallant Cornishman</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who slew the giant Cormoran.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At once the giant knew who Jack was, and he
was filled with joy at the thought that now he had
the lad in his power. He did not wait for Jack to
waken, but swung him up on his shoulder, and
made off with him through the forest.</p>

<p>Now Blunderbore was so tall that his shoulders
were up among the branches as he strode along,
and the boughs whipped Jack in the face and
woke him from his sleep. He was greatly amazed
to find himself journeying along among the leaves
on the giant’s shoulder instead of resting quietly
beside the fountain. However, he was not afraid.
“I can do nothing at present,” thought he to himself,
“but after awhile the giant will put me down,
and then my wits will soon teach me a way to get
the better of him.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The giant strode along without stop or stay
until at last he came to a great gloomy castle and,
this was where he lived. He carried Jack in
through the door into the castle and up a flight of
stone steps to a room that was directly over the
outer doorway. Here he came to a halt and threw
Jack down upon a heap of straw in the corner.</p>

<p>“Lie there for awhile, my little giant-killer,”
cried he. “I have a brother who is not only
bigger and stronger than I am, but has more wits
as well. I will go off and fetch him, and after he
gets here then we will decide what to do with you.”</p>

<p>So saying the giant left the room, and after locking
the door behind him he made off across the
hills in search of his brother.</p>

<p>No sooner was Jack left alone than he began to
examine the room. He quickly noticed that the
door of the castle was directly under his window.
In one corner of the room lay a great coil of rope.
Jack took up this rope and made a slip noose in one
end of it. This noose he hung from the window.
The other end he passed over a great beam overhead.
Then he sat down and waited for the
monster to return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not have long to wait. Soon he heard
the giant and his brother talking and grumbling
together as they came up the road to the castle.
He waited until they had reached the doorway
and were directly under the window. Then he
dropped the slip noose over both their heads.
Quickly snatching up the other end of the rope he
pulled with all his might and drew the two giants
up into the air, struggling and kicking. He then
leaned from the window and with his sword he
cut off both their heads.</p>

<p>It did not take him long after that to slide down
the rope and get the keys that hung from Blunderbore’s
belt. With these in his hand he reëntered
the castle and went all through it, unlocking door
after door.</p>

<p>He opened the giant’s treasure-chamber and
found it full of gold and silver and jewels and all
sorts of precious stuffs that had been stolen from
the people of the land, for Blunderbore was a great
robber.</p>

<p>In the dungeons under the castle were many
merchants and noblemen and fair ladies whom the
giant had robbed and kept as prisoners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>When these people found that Jack had come to
free them, and that he had killed the giant,
they were so glad and grateful that there was
nothing they would not have done for the lad.
Some of them wept for joy.</p>

<p>Jack led them to the treasure-chamber and bade
them take all they could carry of the treasures
that were there. They would gladly have left it
all for him, but the lad would have none of it.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he said. “I have no need of riches,
and if I were loaded down with gold and silver I
could not travel about so lightly as I do.”</p>

<p>He bade the grateful people good-by and
journeyed on his way, leaving them to find their
own way home, which, no doubt they all did in good
time.</p>

<p>By evening of the next day Jack was well away
from Blunderbore’s forest, and just as he was
wondering where he should find food and shelter
for the night he came to a great house and saw a
light shining from the windows.</p>

<p>He knocked, and the door was opened to him by
a giant with two heads. This giant was quite as
wicked as either Cormoran or Blunderbore, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
he was very sly and cunning. Instead of seizing
Jack and throwing him into a dungeon he made him
welcome. He set a hot supper before him, and
talked with him pleasantly, and after awhile he
showed the lad to a room where he could sleep.</p>

<p>But smiling and pleasant though the giant was
Jack did not trust him. He felt sure the monster
was planning some mischief, so instead of going to
bed after the giant left him, he stole to the door of
the room and listened. He heard the giant striding
up and down, and presently he heard him mutter
to himself,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Though here with me you lodge to-night,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You shall not see the morning light,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Because I mean to kill you quite.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“That you shall not,” thought Jack to himself.
“And if you think I am going to get into bed and
lie there while you beat me with a cudgel you are
mistaken.”</p>

<p>He began to feel about the room, and presently
he found a great billet of wood. This he laid in
the bed in his place, and drew the coverlet over it,
and then he hid in a corner of the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long afterward the giant opened the door.
He crept over to the bed very quietly and felt
where the billet of wood was lying under the covers.
Then he took his club and beat it until, if Jack had
been lying there, he would certainly have been
pounded to a jelly. After that the monster went
back to his own bed well satisfied, and slept and
snored.</p>

<p>But what was his astonishment the next morning
when Jack appeared brisk and smiling and
without so much as even a bruise upon him.</p>

<p>“Did—did you sleep well last night?” stammered
the giant.</p>

<p>“Oh, well enough,” answered Jack, “but a rat
must have run over the bed, for I thought I felt him
whisk his tail in my face once or twice. I looked
for him this morning, but I could not find him, so
perhaps I dreamed it.”</p>

<p>When the giant heard this he was frightened.
He thought Jack must be a wonderful hero to stand
such blows as his and scarcely feel them. However,
he said no more, and the two sat down to
breakfast together. The giant ate and drank as
much as ten men, but Jack had hidden a leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
bag under his doublet and he kept slipping the
food into this as fast as the giant set it before him.
The monster wondered and wondered that such a
small man could eat so much.</p>

<p>After breakfast Jack said, “Now I will show you
a trick, and if you cannot do the same thing then
you will have to own that I am the better fellow of
us two.”</p>

<p>To this the giant agreed. Jack then took a knife
and ripped open the leather bag that was hidden
under his doublet.</p>

<p>“There!” he cried. “Can you do the like?”</p>

<p>The giant was amazed, for he never guessed that
it was only a bag that Jack had cut open. However,
he was not to be outdone. Catching up a knife he
ripped himself open, and that was the end of him.</p>

<p>“The world is well rid of another monster,”
said Jack, and leaving the giant where he lay he
set out in search of further adventures.</p>

<p>He had not gone far along the road when he met
a young prince riding along without any attendants
to follow him. This Prince was the son of the great
King Arthur of Britain, and he had left his father’s
court and ridden out into the world in search of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
lovely lady who had been carried off by a magician.
This magician held her prisoner by his enchantments
and it was to free her that the Prince had
ridden forth alone.</p>

<p>When Jack learned who the Prince was, and the
adventure he was bent on, he begged to be allowed
to go along as an attendant.</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said the Prince, “but
if you travel with me you will fare hard indeed.
I have given away all my money, and I do not
know where to find food or even a place to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Do not let that trouble you,” said Jack.
“Not far from here lives a three-headed giant.
He has a fine castle and a well-stocked larder.
Only leave the matter to me and I will arrange it so
that you can spend the night there and have a fine
feast beside.”</p>

<p>At first the Prince was very unwilling to agree
to this. The adventure seemed to him a very
dangerous one, but in the end Jack persuaded him
to agree to it, and mounting on the Prince’s horse
he set out for the castle, leaving the Prince to
await him by the wayside.</p>

<p>Jack rode briskly along and it did not take him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
long to reach the castle. He knocked boldly at
the door.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” called the giant from within.</p>

<p>“It is your Cousin Jack, and I bring you news,”
answered Jack.</p>

<p>The giant opened the door and looked out.
“Well, Cousin Jack, and what is the news you
bring?”</p>

<p>Why, the news was that a Prince and his company
intended to spend the night in the giant’s
castle, and were even then almost at the door.
If the giant were wise he would flee away and
leave the castle to the Prince. Then after the
Prince and his company had gone the giant might
safely return again.</p>

<p>But no, the monster was not so easily to be
scared out of his castle. “I can drive back five
hundred men,” cried he, “so why should I be
afraid?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but can you drive back two thousand?”
asked Jack.</p>

<p>“Two thousand! Two thousand, did you say?”
Why that was a different matter, and if the Prince
were coming with two thousand men at his back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
then it was indeed time for the giant to hide away.
He then told Jack where there was a secret chamber
all made of iron. There he would hide, and he
begged the lad to lock him in, and not, for any
cause to unlock the door until the Prince had gone.</p>

<p>This Jack promised. He locked the giant in the
secret chamber, and then he rode back to fetch his
master.</p>

<p>That night Jack and the Prince feasted right
merrily on the good things from the monster’s
larder, and the next morning the Prince rode on his
way and Jack unlocked the chamber door and let
the giant out.</p>

<p>“What a blockhead I am!” cried the monster
as soon as he was free. “Yonder in the corner
lie the cap of darkness, the cloak of wisdom, and
the sword of sharpness. If I had only thought of
putting on the cap no one could have seen me, and
I would not have had to hide in the secret chamber.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered Jack. “But thanks
to me you are safe at any rate, and I think I should
be rewarded.”</p>

<p>He then asked the giant to give him the cap,
the cloak, and the sword, and out of gratitude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
giant agreed right gladly. “They will be of more
use to you than to me at any rate,” said the giant,
“for when I need them most is the time when I
forget all about them.”</p>

<p>Jack took the cap, the cloak, and the sword and
thanked the giant for the gifts, and at once set out
after the Prince, whom he found waiting for him
not far away.</p>

<p>They now journeyed on until they came to
another castle where they hoped to spend the
night. Here they were made welcome, and bidden
to feast with the noble lady who was the mistress
there. This lady was, indeed, the very one of
whom the Prince was in search, but he did not know
her, and she did not know him because of the spell
of enchantment that was upon her.</p>

<p>After the lady, the Prince, and Jack had feasted
together the lady drew out a precious handkerchief
and passed it over her lips. “To-morrow,” said
she, “you shall tell me to whom I have given this
handkerchief in the night. If you cannot tell me
this, you shall never leave this castle alive.”</p>

<p>The Prince was greatly troubled when he heard
these words, but Jack bade him have no fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
He waited until the lady left them, and then he put
the cap of darkness on his head and followed her,
and she could not see him because of the cap.
She did not know that anyone followed her, and
she went out from the castle and along a path to
the edge of a wood. There she was met by a tall
dark man, and because of the cloak of wisdom
which he wore, Jack knew this man at once as a
magician.</p>

<p>The lady gave him the handkerchief. “That is
well,” said the magician. “To-morrow I will
change this bold Prince into another marble statue
to adorn my hall. As to his servant I will change
him into a dog, a fox, or a deer as the fancy strikes
me.”</p>

<p>“That you shall not!” cried Jack, and drawing
the sword of sharpness he struck the magician’s
head from his shoulders with one blow.</p>

<p>At once the lady was freed from the enchantment,
and she looked about her like one wakening
from a dream. She did not know where she was
nor how she came there.</p>

<p>Jack led her back to the castle and no sooner
did the Prince and she meet than they knew each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
other. They were filled with joy, and the Prince
made ready to take her back with him to his
father’s court. He wished Jack to come with him,
and promised that if he would he should be made
a great nobleman, but to this the giant-killer
would not consent. He still had work to do in his
own country, and he would never leave Wales
until it was freed entirely from the pest of giants.</p>

<p>So the Prince and his lady bade Jack farewell,
and rode away together, while Jack set out in
search of further adventures.</p>

<p>He had traveled a long distance, and night was
falling when he heard doleful cries sounding from
a wood near by. A moment later a giant came
breaking out from the wood dragging a knight and
a lady with him. He had captured them and was
taking them with him to his cave.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s pause, Jack put on his cap
of darkness, and running up close to the giant he
cut him down with one single blow of his sword.
The lady and the knight were amazed. They had
seen no one, and yet the giant had suddenly fallen
dead, cleft through with a sword. They were still
more amazed when Jack lifted the cap from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
head and appeared before them. He then explained
to them who he was, and how he had been
able to kill the giant so strangely.</p>

<p>“This is a wonderful story,” said the knight,
“and you have saved us from worse than death.”
He and his lady then begged Jack to come back
with them to their castle, and to this he agreed, for
he was weary with all his adventures.</p>

<p>When they reached the castle, a great feast was
made ready, and Jack was treated with the greatest
honor. He sat at the knight’s right hand, and all
the best in the castle was none too good for him.</p>

<p>But while they were still in the midst of their
feasting, a messenger arrived in great haste. His
face was pale, and his teeth chattered with fear.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried the knight. “What is the
news you bring?”</p>

<p>“The giant! The great giant Thundel!” cried
the messenger. “He has heard that Jack-the-Giant-Killer
is here, and he is coming to destroy
this castle and all who are in it.”</p>

<p>Even the knight turned pale at this news, but
Jack bade him have no fear. “I had intended to
set out in search of this giant,” said he, “but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he has saved me the trouble.” He then asked
the knight to send for a dozen stout workmen.
This was done and Jack at once led the workmen
out to the bridge that crossed the moat, and bade
them cut the timbers almost through so that they
would only bear the weight of one man, or of two at
most. This bridge was the only way of entrance,
and unless the giant crossed it he could not get
to the castle.</p>

<p>While the workmen were still busy over their
task, the giant appeared, striding along toward
the castle. At once Jack slipped on his cap of
darkness and hurried out to meet him.</p>

<p>The giant could not see Jack because of his
cap of darkness, but his sense of smell was very
keen. He stopped short, and began to snuff about
him like a hound.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Fee, fi, fo, fum!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I smell the blood of an Englishman;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Be he alive or be he dead,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">cried the giant.</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said Jack, “but first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
you will have to catch him.” He then jumped
about from one side of the giant to the other.
“Here! Here I am!” he cried. “Here to the
right of you! No, to the left. Quick, quick, if
you would catch me.”</p>

<p>The giant turned first one way and then the
other, clutching at the empty air, for Jack was
invisible and so was easily able to keep out of
his reach.</p>

<p>At last the lad tired of the game. He looked
behind him and saw that the workmen had finished
their task and had retreated to the castle. He then
caught the cap of darkness from his head and ran
across the bridge. “Now, you miller-giant, who
would grind my bones, catch me if you can,” he
cried.</p>

<p>The giant gave a bellow of rage and ran after
Jack, who had already reached the other side.
The timbers held till the giant was in the middle of
the bridge; then, with a great crash, they gave way
beneath him, and down he fell into the moat and
was drowned. So Jack saved the lives of the
knight and his lady for the second time, and freed
the land of still another giant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>But now came the most dangerous of all of
Jack’s adventures.</p>

<p>Gargantua was the greatest and most powerful
of all the giants, and he was a magician as well.
He lived on the top of a high mountain, and from
there he would come down to rob and steal and
carry off prisoners. These prisoners he changed
into various sorts of wild animals, and he kept
them in the gardens that surrounded his palace.
He had carried off a duke’s only daughter in this
way, and had changed her into a doe.</p>

<p>The duke had been in despair over the loss of his
daughter for she was his only child and he loved
her dearly. He promised that anyone who brought
her back to him should have her for his bride, and
because she was very beautiful many princes and
brave heroes had gone in search of her, but of them
all none had ever returned.</p>

<p>It was this dangerous giant that Jack determined
to seek out and destroy.</p>

<p>He girded the sword of sharpness at his side
and took his cap of darkness and his cloak of wisdom
and set out.</p>

<p>He journeyed on and journeyed on, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
awhile he came to a high and rocky mountain, and
at the very top of it he could see a great castle with
gardens around it and high walls.</p>

<p>Jack climbed up and up over rock and brier,
stump and stone, until he came to the gate of the
garden. There he stopped to put the cap of darkness
on his head; then he ventured in.</p>

<p>The gardens were very fine, as he saw at once,
and many animals were grazing on the grass, or
resting in the shadows. One of them, a beautiful
doe, raised its head and looked toward him,
then at once came over to him and rested its
head on his arm, and looked up at him with its
great dark eyes.</p>

<p>Jack was very much troubled at this. He feared
there was some enchantment about the place that
made him visible in spite of his cap of darkness.
However, none of the other animals paid any
attention to him, so he hoped it was only the doe
that could see him.</p>

<p>He went on through the gardens until he came
to the door of the castle, and there hanging beside
it was a golden horn, and on the horn were these
words:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whoever doth this trumpet blow</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall soon the giant overthrow,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And break the black enchantment straight,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So all shall be in happy state.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Jack raised the horn to his lips and blew a
blast so loud and clear that the castle echoed
with it.</p>

<p>At once a wonderful change came over the garden.
The doe beside him changed into a maiden
more beautiful than any Jack had ever dreamed of.
The wild animals became princes and heroes and
noble ladies.</p>

<p>As for the castle itself, it fell into ruins; a great
chasm yawned under it, and into this chasm it
crumbled with a dreadful noise, carrying the giant
with it. Then the ground closed over the ruins and
not a single stone was left to mark the place where
the castle had stood.</p>

<p>So ended the last of Jack’s adventures, and so
perished the last and most wicked of all his giant
foes. From then on the land was at peace.</p>

<p>Jack was married to the beautiful maiden who
had followed him as a doe, and as she was the
duke’s daughter the poor lad became very rich and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
powerful. He and the duke’s daughter loved
each other dearly, and so they lived in great happiness
all their lives, honored by everyone about
them.</p>

</div>




<h2>THE THREE WISHES</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a poor man took his ax and
went out into the forest to cut wood. He was a
lazy fellow, so as soon as he was in the forest he
began to look about to see which tree would be the
easiest to cut down. At last he found one that was
hollow inside, as he could tell by knocking upon it
with his ax. “It ought not to take long to cut this
down,” said he to himself. He raised his ax and
struck the tree such a blow that the splinters flew.</p>

<p>At once the bark opened and a little old fairy with
a long beard came running out of the tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by chopping into my house?”
he cried; and his eyes shone like red hot sparks, he
was so angry.</p>

<p>“I did not know it was your house,” said the
man.</p>

<p>“Well, it is my house, and I’ll thank you to let
it alone,” cried the fairy.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the man. “I’d just as lieve
cut down some other tree. I’ll chop down the one
over yonder.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the fairy. “I see that you
are an obliging fellow, after all. I have it in my
mind to reward you for sparing my house, so the
next three wishes you and your wife make shall
come true, whatever they are; and that is your
reward.”</p>

<p>Then the fairy went back into the tree again and
pulled the bark together behind him.</p>

<p>The man stood looking at the tree and scratching
his head. “Now that is a curious thing,” said he.
Then he sat down and began to wonder what he
should wish for. He thought and he thought, but
he could decide on nothing. “I’ll just go home
and talk it over with my wife,” said he; so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
shouldered his ax, and set off for home. As soon
as he came in at the door he began to bawl for his
wife, and she came in a hurry, for she did not know
what had happened to him.</p>

<p>He told his story and his wife listened. “This
is a fine thing to have happen to us,” said she.
“Now we must be very careful what we wish for.”</p>

<p>They sat down one on each side of the fire to
talk it over. They thought of ever so many things
they would like to have—a bag of gold, and a
coach and four, and a fine house to live in, and fine
clothes to wear, but nothing seemed just the right
thing to choose.</p>

<p>They talked so long that they grew hungry.
“Well, here we sit,” said the man, “and not a thing
cooked for dinner. I wish we had one of those fine
black puddings you used to make.”</p>

<p>No sooner had he spoken than there was a great
thumping and bumping in the chimney and a great
black pudding fell down on the hearth before him.</p>

<p>“What is this?” cried the man staring.</p>

<p>“Oh, you oaf! you stupid!” shrieked his wife.
“It’s the pudding you wished for. There’s one
of our wishes wasted. I wish the pudding were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
stuck on the end of your nose! It would serve you
right!”</p>

<p>The moment she said this the pudding flew up
and stuck to the man’s nose, and there it was and
he couldn’t get it off; the man pulled and tugged,
and his wife pulled and tugged, but it was all of no
use.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no help for it,” said the husband;
“we’ll have to wish it off again.”</p>

<p>His wife begun to cry and bawl. “No, no,”
she cried. “We only have one wish left, and we
can’t waste it that way. Let’s wish ourselves the
richest people in the world.”</p>

<p>But to this the man would not agree. He
wanted the pudding off his nose whatever it cost.
So at last the wife was obliged to let him have his
own way. “I wish the pudding was off my nose
again,” said the man, and that was the third of
their wishes. So all the good they had of the
fairy’s gift was a black pudding for dinner; but
then it was the best black pudding they had ever
eaten. “And after all,” said the man, “there’s
nothing much better in the world to wish for than
a full stomach.”</p>

<h2>THE GOOSE GIRL</h2>


<p>There was once a beautiful young Princess who
had been promised in marriage to the Prince of a
far country.</p>

<p>When the time for the marriage came she made
ready to journey to his country, for it was there
that the wedding was to be celebrated, and not in
her own land.</p>

<p>Her mother furnished her with all sorts of grand
jewels and beautiful clothes to carry with her, and
furniture and linens, and she also made her a
present of a wonderful horse named Falada, that
could talk.</p>

<p>Just before the Princess was ready to set out, her
mother called her to her, and made a little cut in her
finger, and allowed three drops of blood to fall upon
a handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Here, my child, take this with you,” said the
Queen; “put it in the bosom of your dress, and
guard it carefully. It is a charm, and as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you have it no evil of any kind can have power over
you.”</p>

<p>The Princess thanked her mother, and put the
handkerchief in the bosom of her dress as she was
told. Then she kissed the Queen tenderly, and
bade her farewell, and set out upon the journey
with her waiting-maid riding beside her.</p>

<p>Now this waiting-maid, who rode with the
Princess, had a very bad heart. She was both
sly and deceitful. She pretended to the Queen
that she loved the Princess dearly, but all the
while she hated and envied her, and would have
been glad enough to do her an ill turn.</p>

<p>She and the Princess journeyed on together for
some time, and the sun shone bright and hot
and the road was dusty, so the Princess became
very thirsty. Presently they came to a stream, and
there the Princess drew rein, and said to the waiting-maid,
“Light down, I pray of you, and fill my
little golden cup that I may drink, for I am thirsty.”</p>

<p>But the waiting-maid scowled and answered
rudely, “Light down yourself, and drink from the
stream, if you are thirsty. I am tired of serving
you.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess was very much surprised at being
answered in such a manner. However, she was
young and timid, and without more words she
slipped from her horse, and as she was afraid to
ask for the cup, which the waiting-maid carried,
she stooped over and drank from the brook as it
rippled over its stones.</p>

<p>As she did so the drops of blood upon the
handkerchief said to her:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If thy mother knew thy fate</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then her heart would surely break.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Princess made no answer, but having
quenched her thirst she mounted her horse again
and rode forward, and presently forgot her maid’s
rudeness.</p>

<p>After awhile they reached another stream, and
as the Princess was again thirsty, she said to the
waiting-maid, “Light down, I pray you, and fill
my cup with water, that I may drink.”</p>

<p>But the waiting-maid answered even more rudely
than before, “No, I will not; get down and get the
water for yourself, for I will serve you no more.”</p>

<p>The Princess slipped from her horse, sighing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
deeply, and as she bent over the stream the three
drops of blood said to her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If thy mother knew thy fate,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then her heart would surely break.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Princess made no answer, but as she stooped
still lower to drink the handkerchief slipped from
her bosom and floated away on the stream, but the
Princess did not notice this because her eyes were
full of tears. The waiting-maid noticed it, however,
and her heart was filled with joy, because
now the Princess had nothing to protect her, and
the wicked servant could do with her as she chose.</p>

<p>When the Princess arose and was about to mount
Falada the waiting-maid said to her, “Wait a bit!
I am tired of acting as your servant. Now, we will
try it the other way around. Give me your fine
clothes, and you can dress yourself in these common
things I am wearing.”</p>

<p>The Princess was afraid to refuse; she gave the
waiting-maid her beautiful dress and her jewels,
and dressed herself in the common clothes.</p>

<p>Again she was about to mount Falada, but again
the waiting-maid bade her stay; “You shall ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
my horse,” said she, “and I will ride Falada.”
As she said so it was done. The waiting-maid also
made the Princess swear that she would tell
no living soul who she was. The Princess dared
not refuse for fear of her life. But Falada made no
such promise, and he had seen and heard all that
had happened.</p>

<p>When they rode on again the waiting-maid was
in front, dressed in the fine clothes and mounted
on Falada, and the Princess came behind on the
waiting-maid’s horse, and she was dressed in the
common clothes, but even so she was far more
beautiful than the servant.</p>

<p>They reached the palace, and the Prince came
out to meet his bride. He lifted down the waiting-maid
from Falada, for he thought she was the
Princess, and he led her up the grand stairway and
into the room where the King sat, but the Princess
was left below in the courtyard, and no one paid
any attention to her.</p>

<p>The King was surprised when he saw the waiting-maid,
for he supposed her to be the Princess, and
he had expected her to be much more beautiful.
However, he said nothing about it to anyone, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
made her welcome. Presently he happened to
look out of the window, and there he saw the true
Princess down below. “Who is that standing
in the courtyard?” he asked, for he saw at once
that she was very beautiful, and he was curious
about it.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is only my waiting-maid,” answered
the false bride carelessly. “I wish you would give
her some work to do so that she may not be spoiled
by idleness.”</p>

<p>“I do not know what she can do except take
care of the geese,” answered the King. “Conrad,
who is the goose-herd, is only a boy, and he would
be glad of help in caring for them.”</p>

<p>“Very well; then let her be a goose-herd,”
answered the false bride.</p>

<p>So the Princess went out in the field to help tend
the geese, and the waiting-maid lived in the palace,
and was treated to all that was best there. But
the Prince was not happy, for his bride was rude
and ill-tempered, and he could not love her.</p>

<p>One day the false bride said to the Prince, “I
wish you would have Falada’s head cut off. I am
weary of him, and besides he stumbles when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
ride him.” But really she feared Falada might
speak and tell all he had seen.</p>

<p>The Prince was shocked. “Why should you
kill a horse that is so beautiful and gentle?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Because, as I tell you, I do not like him,” answered
the waiting-maid. “Besides the horse is
mine, and I can do as I like with him. If you
refuse to have this done I shall know very well
that it is because you do not love me.”</p>

<p>The Prince dared refuse no longer. He sent
for a man and had Falada’s head cut off.</p>

<p>When the true Princess heard this she wept
bitterly. She sent for the man and offered him a
piece of gold if he would bring Falada’s head and
nail it up over the gateway through which she
passed every morning.</p>

<p>The man was anxious to have the gold. He
took the money and nailed Falada’s head up over
the gateway where the Princess wished it put.</p>

<p>The next morning as the Princess and Conrad
drove the geese out to pasture she looked up at
Falada and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Falada, that thou shouldst hang there!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">And Falada answered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Princess, that thou shouldst pass here!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If thy mother knew thy fate,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then her heart would surely break!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The little goose-herd stared and wondered
to hear this talk between the goose-girl and
the horse’s head, but he said nothing. He and the
Princess went on out to the meadows driving the
geese before them, and when they were far off in
the meadows where no one could see, the Princess
sat down and unbound her golden hair, so that it
fell all about her in a shower, and began to comb it.</p>

<p>Conrad had never seen anything so beautiful in
all his life before, for her hair shone and glittered
in the sunshine until it was enough to dazzle one.
He longed to have just one thread of it to keep, so
he crept up behind the Princess, meaning to steal
one. But the Princess knew what he was about.
Just as he reached out his hand she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Blow, wind, blow!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blow Conrad’s hat away.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It is rolling! Do not stay</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till I have combed my hair</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And tied it up again.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>At once the wind caught Conrad’s hat from his
head and sent it flying and rolling across the meadows,
and Conrad was obliged to run after it or he
would have lost it.</p>

<p>By the time he came back again with the hat
the Princess had combed her hair and fastened it
up under her cap so that not a thread of it could be
seen.</p>

<p>Conrad was very cross when he went home with
the Princess that evening. He would not speak a
word to her.</p>

<p>The next morning when they started out with the
geese they passed under the gateway as usual, and
the Princess looked up and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Falada, that thou shouldst hang there!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>And the head answered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Princess, that thou shouldst pass here!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If thy mother knew thy fate,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then her heart would surely break.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Conrad listened and wondered, but said nothing.</p>

<p>When they reached the meadow the Princess let
down her hair as before and began to comb it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
looked so beautiful and glittering and bright that
Conrad felt he must have a hair of it. He crept up
behind her and then, just as he was about to seize
it, the Princess sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Blow, wind, blow!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blow Conrad’s hat away.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It is rolling! Do not stay</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till I have combed my hair</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And tied it up again.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At once the wind whirled Conrad’s hat away
across the meadows, and he had to run after it to
catch it.</p>

<p>When he came back he was so sulky that he would
not even look at the Princess, but already she had
her hair combed and fastened up under her cap.</p>

<p>That evening the goose-herd went to the King
and said, “I do not wish that girl to go out to the
meadows with me any more. I would rather take
care of the geese by myself.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the King. “What is the matter
with her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she vexes me, and she has strange ways
that I cannot understand.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“What ways?” asked the King.</p>

<p>Then Conrad told him how every day as he and
the girl passed through the gateway she would look
up at the horse’s head and say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Falada, that thou shouldst hang there!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class='unindent'>And how the head would answer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Princess that thou shouldst pass here!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If thy mother knew thy fate,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then her heart would surely break.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“I do not like such strange ways,” said Conrad.</p>

<p>The King looked thoughtful and stroked his
beard. Then he told Conrad not to say anything
about this matter to anyone. “I myself,” said he,
“will watch by the gateway to-morrow morning,
for I wish to hear for myself exactly what passes
between the girl and Falada.”</p>

<p>So the next morning very early the King hid himself
in the shadow beside the gateway, and presently
the Princess and Conrad came along driving
the geese before them.</p>

<p>As they reached the gateway the Princess looked
up and sighed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Falada, that thou shouldst hang there!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">And the head answered:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Ah, Princess, that thou shouldst pass here!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If thy mother knew thy fate,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then her heart would surely break.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After they had spoken thus the King stepped
out from the shadow and called to the Princess.
“What is the meaning of these words?” asked he.
“Who are you, and what is your story?”</p>

<p>The Princess began to weep. “Alas, I cannot
answer,” said she, “for I have sworn that I would
not tell a single living soul.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the King, “if you have sworn,
then you must keep your oath; but to-night, after
all the servants have left the bakehouse go and
tell your story to the great oven that is there.”</p>

<p>This the Princess promised she would do. So
that night, when she came home, she went into the
bakehouse and looked about her. She saw no
one, and she thought she was alone there, but
the King had hidden himself inside the oven,
though she did not know it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Princess began to tell her story to the
oven. She told how she had left home with her
false-hearted waiting-maid. She told of how she
had lost the kerchief with the drops of blood upon it,
and how the waiting-maid had made her exchange
clothing with her and dress herself as a servant;
and she told how she had been forced to swear
that she would not tell all this to a living soul. All,
the whole story, she told to the bake-oven, and the
King sat inside of it and listened and understood.</p>

<p>When she had made an end of speaking the
King came out and took her by the hand. “You
have been very cruelly treated,” said he, “but
now your sorrows are over.”</p>

<p>He then led the Princess into the palace, and
she was dressed in the richest clothes that were
there, and when this was done she was as beautiful
as the moon when the clouds drift over it.</p>

<p>The King sent for the Prince, and when he saw
the Princess he was filled with joy and love, and he
knew at once that this must be his true bride.</p>

<p>He and the King planned together as to how the
false bride should be punished. And this is what
was done:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>A grand feast and entertainment were arranged.
The Prince sat upon a high seat with the false bride
upon one hand and the true bride upon the other.
But the false bride was so dazzled by all the splendor,
and by her own pride that she did not even
see the Princess.</p>

<p>Everyone ate and drank to his heart’s content,
and then the King began asking riddles. After the
riddles he said he would tell the guests a story,
and the story he told was that of the Princess and
the waiting-maid, and still the false bride was too
dazzled by her own splendor to understand the
story.</p>

<p>When he had finished the story the King asked,
“What should be the punishment of such a false
servant as that?”</p>

<p>Then the false bride cried boldly, “She should
be taken to a high cliff and thrown over into the
sea.”</p>

<p>“So shall it be,” cried the King sternly, “for
you yourself are that false servant, and here sits
the true bride whom you have wronged.”</p>

<p>Then the waiting-maid understood what she had
done, and she was filled with terror. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Princess had pity on her, and begged for mercy
for her. So the waiting-maid was not thrown into
the sea, but her fine clothes were stripped from
her, and she was driven out to beg her way
through the world.</p>

<p>Then the Prince and Princess were married and
lived happily ever after, and Falada’s head was
taken down and placed upon his body and he
came to life again and lived for many years in the
castle stable, and the Princess loved him dearly.</p>

<h2>THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN AND HER PIG</h2>


<p>One time a little old woman was sweeping her
room, and she found in the corner a bright silver
shilling. “There!” said the old woman, “Now
I can buy that little pig I have been wanting for
such a long time.”</p>

<p>She finished her sweeping in a hurry and put
on her bonnet and her shawl and started off to
market to buy her pig, and she carried a tin pail
with her so she could gather blackberries along
the way.</p>

<p>The bushes were fairly loaded down with berries,
so it did not take her long to fill her pail, and after
that she got to market in no time.</p>

<p>At first she could not find just the pig she wanted.
Some were too little and some were too big; some
were too fat and some were too thin. But at last
she found just exactly the right pig; it was round
and pink and it had one black ear, and the curliest
tail there was in the market. She paid just exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a shilling for it, and then she tied a rope around its
hind leg and started home with it, driving it before
her, and carrying the pail of blackberries on her arm.</p>

<p>At first all went well. The little pig trotted
quietly along, and the sun shone, and the birds
sang, and the little white clouds floated across the
sky. But presently they came to a stile, and the
pig did not want to go over it. Now, there was no
way to go round, and no way to get home except
over this stile.</p>

<p>“Go on, piggy,” said the old woman, shaking the
rope. But piggy wouldn’t go on. The old woman
tried to drive him, and he wouldn’t go, and then
she tried to lead him, and then she coaxed him and
talked to him, but he just <i>wouldn’t</i> go over the stile.</p>

<p>At last the old woman quite lost patience with
him. She saw a dog trotting along the road, and
she called to him. “Here! here, good dog; come
and bite piggy, for I can’t make pig go over the
stile, and at this rate I won’t get home till midnight
with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>The dog stopped and looked at her and looked
at the pig, but he would not bite it.</p>


<p>Close by a stick lay in the road, and the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
called to it (and she was quite cross by this time).
“Stick, stick, beat dog; dog won’t bite pig, pig
won’t go over the stile, and at this rate I shan’t get
home till midnight with my pail of fine ripe
blackberries.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="images/i_b_094.jpg" width="467" height="469" alt="Woman with pig on leash" />
<div class="caption">THE PIG WOULD NOT GO OVER THE STILE</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>But the stick wouldn’t. It lay there quietly in
the road just as though she hadn’t spoken to it.</p>

<p>Over in the field a fire was burning, and the
old woman called to it, “Fire, fire, burn stick;
stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig, pig won’t
go over the stile, and at this rate I won’t get home
till midnight with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>But the fire wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Then the old woman called to a brook near by,
“Water, water, quench fire; fire won’t burn stick,
stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig, pig won’t
go over the stile, and I shan’t get home till midnight
with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>But the brook wouldn’t.</p>

<p>She saw an ox over in the field. “Ox, ox,” she
cried, “drink water; water won’t quench fire, fire
won’t burn stick, stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t
bite pig, pig won’t go over the stile, and I shan’t
get home till midnight with my pail of fine ripe
blackberries.”</p>

<p>But the ox wouldn’t.</p>

<p>She saw a butcher riding along the road, and she
called to him “Butcher, butcher, kill ox; ox won’t
drink water, water won’t quench fire, fire won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
burn stick, stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite
pig, pig won’t go over the stile, and I won’t get
home till midnight with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>But the butcher wouldn’t.</p>

<p>There was a piece of rope twisted about the
fence. “Rope, rope,” she cried, “hang butcher;
butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t drink water, water
won’t quench fire, fire won’t burn stick, stick won’t
beat dog, dog won’t bite pig, pig won’t go over the
stile, and I shan’t get home till midnight with my
pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>But the rope wouldn’t.</p>

<p>Then she called to a rat that lived in a hole
under the stile, “Rat, rat, gnaw rope; rope won’t
hang butcher, butcher won’t kill ox, ox won’t
drink water, water won’t quench fire, fire won’t
burn stick, stick won’t beat dog, dog won’t bite pig,
pig won’t go over the stile, and I shan’t get home
till midnight with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>But the rat wouldn’t.</p>

<p>A cat was sitting on a gate-post. “Puss, puss,
catch rat,” called the old woman. “Rat won’t
gnaw rope, rope won’t hang butcher, butcher won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
kill ox, ox won’t drink water, water won’t quench
fire, fire won’t burn stick, stick won’t beat dog, dog
won’t bite pig, and I shan’t get home till midnight
with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered puss, “I am very comfortable
sitting here. Why should I disturb myself just to
please you. But if you will get the red cow to give
you a saucerful of milk for me then I will catch
the rat.”</p>

<p>So the little old woman tied the pig to the stile,
and then she climbed over the fence into the field
where the red cow was standing.</p>

<p>“Please, good cow, give me a saucerful of milk
for puss,” she said, “so that puss will catch the rat
that won’t gnaw the rope that won’t hang the
butcher who won’t kill the ox that won’t drink the
water that won’t quench the fire that won’t burn the
stick that won’t beat the dog that won’t bite the pig
that won’t go over the stile so that I can get home
before midnight with my pail of fine ripe blackberries.”</p>

<p>Said the cow, “If you will go over yonder to
where the haymakers are working and fetch me a
wisp of hay to eat, then I will give you the milk.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>So the little old woman went over to the haymakers
and said, “Please, good kind haymakers,
give me a wisp of hay to give to the cow so that
she may give me some milk to give to the cat.”</p>

<p>The haymakers were very hot and thirsty and
they said, “Very well; if you will go down to the
stream and fetch us a pailful of water we will give
you the hay.”</p>

<p>So the little old woman emptied out her blackberries
on the ground very carefully and then she
hurried down to the stream and brought back to
the haymakers a pailful of fresh cool water.</p>

<p>The haymakers drank deep of it and then they
gave the little old woman all the hay she wanted.
She put the blackberries back in the pail and hurried
back to the cow with the hay.</p>

<p>The cow gladly gave her a saucerful of milk in
return for the hay.</p>

<p>The old woman took the milk to the cat, and
while puss was drinking it the old woman untied
the rope that fastened the pig to the stile.</p>

<p>Puss finished the milk and licked up the last
drop of it, and then she bounded down beside the
stile and began to catch the rat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The rat squeaked with terror and began to
gnaw the rope.</p>

<p>The rope began to hang the butcher, the butcher
began to kill the ox, the ox began to drink the
water, the water began to quench the fire, the fire
began to burn the stick, the stick began to beat the
dog, the dog began to bite the pig, and the pig
squealed at the top of its lungs and scrambled
over the stile and ran for home so fast that the
little old woman could hardly keep up with it.</p>

<p>They got home in less than no time; it wasn’t
even midday, and the little old woman had her
blackberries for dinner, and what was left over she
gave to the pig.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE CAT</h2>


<p>There was once a king who had three sons,
and he loved them all so tenderly that each one
was dearer to him than the others. He loved them
all so well that he could not make up his mind to
which one to leave his kingdom. He thought and
thought, and then he called his wise old councilor
to him and asked his advice.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said the Councilor, “you love all
three of the princes equally, and so my advice
is to leave the kingdom to the one who loves you
best.”</p>

<p>“But I do not know which one loves me best,”
said the King.</p>

<p>“Then set them three tasks. The one who
performs the tasks the best, and who takes the
most trouble to please you,—he must be the one
who bears you the most love.”</p>

<p>This advice pleased the King, and he sent for his
three sons, and told them what he had decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
do. “I have,” said he, “a great wish for a little
dog to amuse me. I will give you a year in which
to find me the smallest and prettiest little dog in
the world. Whichever of you will bring me such
a dog shall receive a third of my kingdom.”</p>

<p>As soon as the princes heard this they were eager
to set out in search of such a dog. The two older
brothers were sure one of them would find it, for
they did not think much of their younger brother.
Each one rode away to a great city, and went to
the best dog dealers there. The eldest son
bought a little white dog no larger than a small
kitten, and very pretty and playful. The second
son bought a red dog so small it could curl up in
the palm of his hand. Each was content with his
choice, and rode home without searching further.</p>

<p>The King was delighted with the dogs they
brought, and his sons wished him to decide at once
as to which of them deserved the kingdom, but
this the King would not do. “No, no,” said he,
“we must wait until your brother comes. He can
hardly find another dog as pretty as these, but still
it is only right to wait until he returns, or until the
year is up.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the youngest prince had ridden
on and on, much farther than either of his other
brothers. Everywhere he asked for dogs, and hundreds
of them were brought to him, big and little,
fat and thin, black and white, and gray and red
and yellow. But not one of them was what the
Prince wanted.</p>

<p>At last one day he came to a deep forest. A
storm had risen; the Prince was wet to the skin
with rain, and covered with mud. He saw a light
before him shining through the trees, and he rode
toward it. He hoped he might find there some
shelter for the night.</p>

<p>What was his surprise, as he drew near the light,
to see it came from a magnificent palace that had
been built here in the deep forest far away from any
city. The Prince knocked at the door and at once it
opened before him. He went in and looked about
him, but he saw no one, though invisible hands
closed the door behind him. An unseen hand took
his and he was led through several rooms to a
handsome chamber that seemed to have been
made ready for him. His wet and muddy clothes
were removed and he was dressed in a suit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
white and silver; but with all this he still saw no
one.</p>

<p>He was then led to a banquet hall where a fine
feast was laid out.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while the Prince stood looking about
him there was a sound of trumpets; the doors
opposite to him swung open, and a strange procession
marched into the room. First, walking upright
came a small and very pretty white cat. She
was dressed all in black, and wore a long black
veil, and an ebony crown. She was followed
by other cats. Some of these were dressed as
ladies-in-waiting, some as courtiers, and some as
trumpeters.</p>

<p>The White Cat came up to the Prince and bade
him welcome. “I saw you as you rode through
the forest,” she said, “and this feast was made
ready for you. Come, Prince, let us take our
places at the table and eat.”</p>

<p>The cat then seated herself at the head of the
table and motioned the Prince to sit beside her.</p>

<p>Unseen hands at once served them with the
most rare and delicious dishes. The cat ate
daintily, and the Prince noticed that she touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
nothing but some oddly cooked birds, and some
cream.</p>

<p>He himself was hungry and ate of everything,
and while he ate the White Cat talked to him with
so much sense and wit that he was delighted with
her.</p>

<p>After supper the White Cat left him and he was
led by invisible hands to a magnificent chamber,
where he spent the night.</p>

<p>The next morning when he awoke he found a
hunting-suit of green laid out for him, and high
riding-boots and a plumed hat. Unseen hands
dressed him, and food was served to him in a
breakfast-room hung about with curtains of satin
embroidered with gold.</p>

<p>After he had eaten, the Prince went in search
of the White Cat. He found her in the courtyard.
She and her attendants and several cats
dressed as huntsmen were about to set out on a
hunt. She invited the Prince to go with them,
and he gladly accepted.</p>

<p>A troop of monkeys all saddled and bridled were
led up to the palace steps. The Prince looked on
in wonder while the White Cat sprang upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
back of the largest and finest monkey. The other
cats also mounted, but as the Prince was too large
to ride a monkey a large wooden horse on wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was brought for him to ride. This seemed so absurd
to the Prince that he was about to refuse,
but the White Cat motioned him to it so politely
that he was ashamed to say no. He sprang to the
back of the wooden steed, and at once he felt it
move and stir under him as though it were alive.
The cat-huntsmen sounded their horns, and away
the hunting-party went. The White Cat and the
Prince rode first, and the Prince found the wooden
horse rolled along so smoothly and swiftly that
nothing could have been pleasanter.</p>

<div class="caption">THE PRINCE GOES HUNTING WITH THE WHITE CAT</div>
</div>

<p>The day was spent in hunting through the forest,
and in the evening there was another grand feast
at the palace, this time with music and dancing.
The dancers were six large black cats dressed in
spangled clothes, and their leaps and bounds
and twirlings were wonderful. The Prince had
never been so well amused in his life before.</p>

<p>Day after day slipped by, and still the Prince
stayed at the White Cat’s palace, and he was so
happy there that he quite forgot his father and
the kingdom he had hoped to win. The year had
passed, all but three days, when suddenly the
Prince remembered his errand. He was filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
with dismay, for now it was too late for him to
seek for a little dog, and he feared he had lost all
chance of winning the kingdom.</p>

<p>But the White Cat saw his trouble. “Do not
be dismayed, Prince,” she said. “I know the
errand that brought you here, and I am ready to
help you.” She then handed him an acorn.
“Here,” she said, “take this and you will find
in it the thing you seek.”</p>

<p>The Prince thought the cat was mocking him,
but she bade him put the acorn to his ear and
listen. When he did this he could hear from
within the acorn a sound of barking as thin and
small as the squeaking of a mouse.</p>

<p>“Do not open it until you reach home,” said the
White Cat. “Then, when your father sees what
is inside of it he will know that you are the one who
deserves the kingdom.”</p>

<p>The Prince thanked the cat, and mounted his
own horse, which had been brought from the
stables, and rode on home. Just before he
reached his father’s palace he bought an ugly dog
from a beggar, and took it with him.</p>

<p>When he entered the palace he went at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the room where his father sat upon his throne
with his two elder sons by him.</p>

<p>When the two princes saw their younger brother
enter the court with the ugly dog at his heels they
laughed aloud with scorn. They felt very sure
that now the kingdom would belong to them.</p>

<p>The King was very much offended. He spoke
to the young Prince harshly. “Why do you bring
such an ugly cur to my court?” he asked. “Have
you no more respect for my wishes than to present
me with such a dog as that?”</p>

<p>The Prince, however, answered gently, “Dear
father, have patience for a moment and I may offer
you something that will please you better.”</p>

<p>He then drew out the acorn and opened it.
Inside it was a tiny satin cushion, and upon this
cushion lay a dog so small and so exquisite that the
King was filled with wonder. He could scarcely
believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Truly you deserve to have the kingdom at
once,” cried he, “but I have promised that there
shall be three trials before I give the kingdom to
any one of you.”</p>

<p>The King then told the princes that he wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
them to bring him a piece of muslin so fine and
delicate that it could be drawn through the eye of
a needle. Whichever one succeeded best should
receive at least a part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The three princes at once set out on this new
errand. The elder brothers sought out the dealers
in great cities as before, but the youngest Prince
rode straight to the castle of the White Cat.</p>

<p>The cat received him kindly. “I know what
is required of you,” she said. “Do not trouble
yourself in the matter. Stay here with me, and
when the proper time arrives you shall have what
is needed.”</p>

<p>So the Prince stayed there in the White Cat’s
palace for a year, all but three days, and the time
passed even more pleasantly than before. At the
end of that time the White Cat gave a walnut to
the Prince. “Take this,” she said, “and do not
open it until you are at home again. Within it
you will find what you desire.”</p>

<p>The Prince took the walnut and rode away. When
he reached the court his brothers were already
there. Each had brought with him a piece of muslin
so fine that it would pass through the eye of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
darning-needle, but they could not draw it through
the eye of a cambric needle.</p>

<p>Then the third Prince took out the walnut and
cracked it. Within it he expected to see a piece of
muslin, but instead he found only a hazel-nut.
He cracked the hazel-nut and inside of it was a
cherry-stone. He cracked the cherry-stone and
inside of it was a grain of wheat. The Prince
began to fear the White Cat had deceived him, and
that he must lose the kingdom. As for his brothers,
they laughed aloud and mocked at him.</p>

<p>“What trick is this that you are playing on us?”
they asked. “If you have the muslin show it to us,
and if not then confess to our father that you have
failed.”</p>

<p>Without answering, the Prince cracked the grain
of wheat, and inside it was a millet-seed. His
heart sank. However, he cracked the millet seed,
and there was the piece of muslin the cat had
promised to him. He shook it out and there were
ells and ells of it and all as fine as gossamer.
Never had such a piece of cloth been seen before.
The King looked and wondered and admired. The
muslin was so fine it could be drawn not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
through the eye of a darning-needle, but through
the eye of a cambric needle as well.</p>

<p>“This is a wonderful piece of cloth,” said the
King to the young Prince. “You have indeed
again deserved the kingdom, but there is one more
task to be performed before I can give it to anyone.
I wish you to bring to me the most beautiful princess
in the world. Whichever of you can do this shall
receive at least a half of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>When the elder brothers heard this they were in
haste to set out. The youngest brother had already
brought to their father the smallest and prettiest
dog in the world, and the finest piece of muslin, but
with good luck one of them might still bring to
him the most beautiful princess. They journeyed
away to far kingdoms where there were princesses
who were famed for their beauty; but the youngest
prince rode no place at all but to the palace of the
White Cat.</p>

<p>The cat welcomed him even more kindly than
before. “I know what you have come to seek,”
said she. “This matter is not so easy as the
others were. But do not be downhearted. I will
help you when the proper time comes.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the days passed pleasantly in the White
Cat’s castle, and the Prince was well content to
stay there. He was so happy that a whole year, all
but a day, slipped by before he thought about it.
Then one morning he awoke, and remembered
that the next day he must be back at the King’s
palace with the most beautiful princess in the
world, if he were to win the kingdom. “Alas,
alas!” he cried. “The kingdom is certainly lost
to me. I have no time left to seek for a princess,
and moreover it is a three days’ journey back to
the palace. Before I reach there the kingdom will
certainly have been divided between my brothers.”</p>

<p>“Have I not promised to help you?” asked the
cat. “Why do you trouble yourself? If you do
exactly as I tell you the kingdom will be yours; and
not that kingdom only, but others beside.”</p>

<p>The cat then told the Prince to draw his sword
and cut off her head, but the Prince refused to do
such an act. He was filled with horror at the bare
thought of it.</p>

<p>The White Cat began to weep bitterly. “What
have I not done for you?” she cried; “and you will
not do even this one thing for me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>She wept and lamented so bitterly that at last
the Prince could refuse no longer. He drew his
sword to cut off the cat’s head, but at the same time
he closed his eyes that he might not see the cruel
deed.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again what was his
wonder to see no cat, but a beautiful princess who
stood before him smiling. Never had he seen
such beauty before.</p>

<p>“Prince,” said the Princess, “you have saved
me from a cruel fate. I was taken by the fairies
when I was a baby and lived with them as a daughter
until I grew up. Then I made them angry
because I would not marry a very rich and ugly
dwarf who was a friend of theirs. They then
changed me and all my companions into cats, and
we were obliged to live in these shapes until some
young and kind-hearted prince would cut off my
head. This you have done, and now we are all restored
to our proper shapes again. This shows
me that the fairies have forgiven me and will give
me back the two kingdoms that were mine by
rights.”</p>

<p>The Princess, a cat no longer, then ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
wooden horse to be brought to the door. She and
the Prince mounted upon it, and away they went,
so fast that the wind whistled past their ears.
The three day’s journey was made in less than a
day, and when the Prince led the Princess into
court, everyone was obliged to own that now he
had indeed fairly won the kingdom. His two
brothers had also brought home with them beautiful
princesses, but neither could compare in beauty
with the bride of the youngest Prince; for his bride
she had promised to be.</p>

<p>As soon as a feast could be prepared, she and
the young Prince were married.</p>

<p>As the Princess had already two kingdoms of
her own she begged the old King to divide his
kingdom between his two elder sons. This was
done, the older princes were married to the
beauties they had brought home with them, and
they all lived in love and happiness forever after.</p>

<h2>BRITTLE-LEGS</h2>


<p>There was once a man who was such a boaster
that scarcely a word he said was true. One day
he was talking with some companions and he said,
“I have no need to work or worry over anything.
I could be richer than the King himself if I chose,
for I have a daughter who can spin straw into gold.”</p>

<p>A nobleman who was passing by overheard this,
and he went to the King and repeated to him what
the man had said.</p>

<p>Now the King of that country was very fond of
gold; he never could have enough of it. He at
once sent to the boaster’s house and had him and
his daughter brought to the palace. They were
brought to where the King sat, and the King said,
“I hear that you have boasted that your daughter
can spin straw into gold. Is that true?”</p>

<p>The man was very much frightened when he
heard this, but he was afraid to deny what he had
already said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, your majesty, that is what I said,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the King. “We shall soon
know whether you have spoken the truth or not. I
have had a large room made ready for your daughter.
It is filled with straw. I will have her taken
to it, and if she spins it into gold you shall be well
rewarded, but if she fails you shall both be punished
severely.”</p>

<p>Both the father and daughter were terrified at
these words. They did not know what would
become of them. The boaster was allowed to go
home, but the girl was taken to a large room filled
with straw, and was left there. She sat and cried
and cried.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened and a crooked little
brown dwarf came into the room.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, what a noise,” said he. “Why are
you crying so bitterly.”</p>

<p>“I am crying because the King has put me here
to spin this straw into gold, and I do not know how
to set about it.”</p>

<p>“That should not be such a hard matter. What
will you give me if I do it for you?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“This necklace around my neck,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“Very well, give it to me.” The dwarf took the
necklace and sat down to the spinning wheel, and it
did not take him long to spin all the straw into
gold—heaps and heaps of it. Then he hopped
away, and no one saw him come or go but the girl.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the King came to see how
the girl was getting on. When he saw the room
full of glittering gold instead of straw he was
filled with joy and wonder. But for all that he was
not satisfied. He led the girl into a still larger
room, and it, too, was full of straw.</p>

<p>“You have done very well,” said he, “but I
expect you to do still better. Spin this straw into
gold for me and the reward shall not be lacking.”
Then he went away, leaving the girl alone.</p>

<p>She sat and cried and cried.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened, and the same little
dwarf came hopping into the room.</p>

<p>“What will you give me,” said he, “if I spin this
straw into gold for you?”</p>

<p>“I will give you the gold ring from my finger,”
answered the girl.</p>

<p>The dwarf sat down at the spinning wheel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
soon all the straw was spun into gold. Then the
dwarf took the ring from the girl’s finger and went
away.</p>

<p>The next day, when the King came and saw all
the gold he was even more delighted than before.
He was now as rich as any emperor, but even yet
he was not content. He took the girl into a still
larger room, and it, like the others, was full of straw.</p>

<p>“If you will spin this, too, into gold, then you
shall be my bride,” said he.</p>

<p>The King had scarcely left her before the dwarf
came hopping into the room. “Well,” said he,
“what will you give me this time if I spin the straw
into gold for you?”</p>

<p>“Alas, alas!” cried the girl, “I have nothing
more to give.”</p>

<p>“Promise me that if the King marries you, you
will give me your first child, and I will help you,”
said the dwarf.</p>

<p>At first the girl did not want to promise this, but
then she thought that after all it was very unlikely
the King would marry her, and even if he did she
might never have a child. “Very well,” said she,
“I promise.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The dwarf laughed aloud and snapped his fingers
with joy. Then he sat down at the spinning wheel
and spun till the wheel whirred. You could
scarcely see it, it flew so fast. Soon all the straw
was spun. “There,” said he, “now you will
not need me again. But do not forget your promise,
for at the right time I shall certainly come to
claim the child.” Then he hopped away, laughing
as he went.</p>

<p>Not long afterward the King came into the room.
He could wait no longer to see whether the girl
had finished her task. When he saw the heaps
of gold, more than ever before, he hardly knew
what to do with himself, he was so happy.</p>

<p>“Now I am satisfied,” said he. “You shall
be my wife, as I promised, and your father shall
be brought to court and become a great nobleman.”</p>

<p>As the King said, so it was done. He and the
girl were married, and her father was sent for to
come and live at the court.</p>

<p>And now the girl was very happy. She loved
the King, and she had forgotten all about the
promise she had made to the dwarf.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of a year a fine little child was born to
the Queen. The whole kingdom was filled with
rejoicings. As to the King he was almost beside
himself with joy.</p>

<p>One day, as the Queen was sitting by the baby’s
cradle, the door opened, and the crooked little dwarf
hopped into the room. When the Queen saw him
she turned as white as paper.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the dwarf, “and are you ready to
keep the promise you made when I spun the straw
into gold for you?”</p>

<p>Then the Queen began to beg and entreat that
the dwarf would leave the baby with her, and not
take it away. She offered him gold and jewels,
and even the golden crown from her head, if he
would only leave her the child. But no—no—the
dwarf had gold and jewels, more than he cared for.
It was the young Prince he wanted.</p>

<p>At last he said, “Listen, I will give you one
chance. If within three days you can guess what
my name is you shall keep the child, but if you
fail in this then you must give him to me, and no
more words about it.”</p>

<p>To this the Queen agreed willingly, for she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
no fear but what she could guess the dwarf’s
name.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone she sent out to all the
neighbors round to learn what were the names of
all the men they knew, and when the dwarf came
the next day she was ready for him.</p>

<p>“Was his name John?” “No, it was not.”
“Was it Henry?” “No.” “Was it James or
Conrad or Phillip or Habbakuk?” “No, no, no;
it was none of them.” The Queen went over all the
names she had learned, but not one of them was
the right one, and the dwarf went away rejoicing.</p>

<p>The next day he came again and the Queen
had a fresh list of names ready, for she had sent
out messengers far and wide, and they had brought
back every name they could hear of. But the
dwarf said no to all of them. Not one of them was
right. Then the Queen’s heart sank within her,
but she plucked up courage, and as soon as the
dwarf had gone, sent out other messengers, but
these brought back not a single name but those
she knew already. The Queen was in despair.
She sat at the window and waited for the dwarf to
come, and she held the baby in her arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she heard the King’s forester talking to
his sweetheart in the courtyard below. He had
heard nothing of how the Queen had sent far and
wide to gather names, for he had been off in the
forest for three days. The forester told his sweetheart
how he had lost his way in the forest the
night before. Then he had come to a hollow, and
it was full of rocks, and a red fire was burning
among them. Around this fire a crooked little
dwarf was dancing and as he danced he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“To-day I brew, to-night I bake,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To-morrow I the young prince take,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For none could guess, unless they were told</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That Brittle-Legs is the name I hold.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the Queen heard that, she laughed aloud.
Then she arose and put the baby down, and sent
word to the forester that he should tell no one else
of what he had seen in the forest.</p>

<p>Not long afterward the dwarf came as usual.</p>

<p>“Well, and have you guessed my name?” he
asked; “for if you have not I must have the
child.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen pretended to be in great trouble.
“Is it—is it Short-Shanks?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No,” cried the dwarf and his eyes shone like
sparks.</p>

<p>“Is it Long-Arms?”</p>

<p>“No,” shouted the dwarf, and he hopped up
and down with joy.</p>

<p>“Is it—is it by any chance Brittle-Legs?”</p>

<p>When the Queen said that the dwarf gave a
scream of rage. His face grew first as black as
thunder, and then as red as fire.</p>

<p>“Someone has told you! Someone has told
you!” he shrieked and he stamped so hard that his
foot sank down into the floor and he could not pull
it out, so he shook it off and hopped away, leaving
one leg behind him, and what became of him after
that nobody ever knew. But the Queen lived
happy and untroubled forever after.</p>

<h2>“I WENT UP ONE PAIR OF STAIRS,” ETC.</h2>


<p>Now I will tell you a joke; whatever I say to you,
you must answer “Just like me.” Now we will
begin.</p>

<p>I went up one pair of stairs.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I went up two pair of stairs.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I turned myself round about.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I went up three pair of stairs.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I made a cross on the wall.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I went up four pair of stairs.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I looked out of a window.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>And I found I was up as high as the highest
tree-top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I saw something moving about in the highest
tree-top.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>I stared and stared to see what it was.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>And then I saw it was a little monkey.</p>

<p><i>Just like me.</i></p>

<p>Just like you! Ha, ha! You said the monkey
was just like you; I think you must be a little
monkey yourself if it looked just like you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now I will tell you something else. I will say
<i>one</i> and then you must say <i>two;</i> I will say <i>three</i>, and
you must say <i>four</i> and so on; but each time we
must say after the number “a dead horse.”
Like this. I say <i>one</i> a dead horse, and you must
say <i>two</i> a dead horse.</p>

<p>Now begin.</p>

<p>One a dead horse.</p>

<p><i>Two a dead horse.</i></p>

<p>Three a dead horse.</p>

<p><i>Four a dead horse.</i></p>

<p>Five a dead horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Six a dead horse.</i></p>

<p>Seven a dead horse.</p>

<p><i>Eight a dead horse.</i></p>

<p>Eight a dead horse! Ate a dead horse! You
said you ate a dead horse. Oh! oh! Did it taste
good? I hope you enjoyed it. For my part I
wouldn’t care to eat a dead horse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now I will tell you what kind of a lock I am, and
you must be the same kind of a key. If I say I am
a gray lock, you must say you are a gray key. If
I say I am a queer lock you must say you are a
queer key. If I say I am a rusty lock you must
say you are a rusty key.</p>

<p>I am a gray lock.</p>

<p><i>I’m a gray key.</i></p>

<p>I’m a red lock.</p>

<p><i>I’m a red key.</i></p>

<p>I’m a dull lock.</p>

<p><i>I’m a dull key.</i></p>

<p>I’m a monk lock.</p>

<p><i>I’m a monk key.</i></p>

<p>You’re a monkey! You’re a monkey. That’s
the second time you’ve said it, so now I’m sure it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
must be so. Well, what other kinds of locks and
keys are we? Let us begin all over again.</p>

<p>I’m a don lock.</p>

<p><i>I’m a don key.</i></p>

<p>Are you indeed? Are you really a dear little

<h2>THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN</h2>


<p>A bean and a hot coal met each other on the
highroad, and as they were both rolling along in
the same direction they soon struck up a friendship.</p>

<p>Presently they were joined by a straw, and the
three began talking together. They were all going
out in the world to seek their fortunes.</p>

<p>“It is just a bit of luck that I can travel about
in this way,” said the bean. “If I had not been
a stout active fellow I would have been boiled into
soup by now. The mistress was about to throw
me into the pot with a lot of other beans, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
managed to slip through her fingers and rolled out
through the doorway and down the steps without
her even noticing I was gone.”</p>

<p>“That was a clever trick,” said the hot coal.
“I, too, am a lively chap. I and my brothers were
set to heat a kettle, but I jumped out of the fire, and
I was so hot the cook did not dare to touch me.
She pushed me out of doors with her foot, and now
I am free to go about the world as I choose, and
seek my fortune.”</p>

<p>The straw sighed. “I was never as active as
that,” she said. “Always wherever the wind
blew me I went. The farmer had picked up a
whole armful of straws to make a bed for the cow;
but the wind caught me up and carried me off—and
here I am.”</p>

<p>While they were talking in this way the comrades
came to a brook, and this stopped their
journey, for they did not know how to get across.
The straw could easily have sailed over on the first
puff of wind, but that way would not do for the other
two.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said the straw. “I am long enough
to reach from one side of the stream to the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
I will lay myself across it like a bridge, and then
you can both walk on over me without getting wet.”</p>

<p>To this plan the other two were glad to agree, so
the straw laid herself across the stream.</p>

<p>“You go first,” said the bean, for he was a
cautious fellow, and wanted to see whether the
bridge was safe before he tried it.</p>

<p>The coal, however, was quick and fiery. He
ran out on the straw, but half-way over he grew
dizzy and had to stop.</p>

<p>“Quick! quick!” cried the straw. “I am
burning”; for the coal was still very hot.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said the coal, balancing himself. “Just
a minute!”</p>

<p>But the straw could not wait even for a minute.
The coal had burned through it, and down they
both went into the water, the coal hissing as it
fell.</p>

<p>That seemed so comical to the bean that it
began to laugh. It laughed and laughed; it
laughed so hard that at last it split its skin, and
that would have been the end of it if a tailor had
not chanced to come by just then.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” cried the bean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>The tailor looked all about him, and then he saw
the bean lying on the ground. He picked it up,
and it did not take him long to see what was the
matter with it. “This slit can be easily mended,”
said he, and he whipped out his needle and thread
and sewed up the bean in a trice. Unluckily he
had only black thread, and the stitches made a
line of black down the side of the bean. And
ever since then, if you look, you will see that every
bean of that kind has a black line down one side
of it.</p>

<h2>THE WATER-SPRITE</h2>


<p>A little brother and sister were playing one day
on the edge of a well that belonged to a water-sprite.
The little girl held her brother’s hand,
and leaned far over to look down into it.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that down below there I can
see green meadows and flocks of sheep moving
over them,” she said.</p>

<p>“It is only the reflection of the clouds,” said the
little boy. “But be careful. I fear you will
fall in.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the little girl slipped and fell
into the well, and as she had hold of her brother’s
hand she pulled him in after her.</p>

<p>The two children went down—down—down—through
the waters, and when they came to the
bottom they found themselves in a country of
green meadows and trees and streams, and before
them stood a shining castle with domes and towers.</p>

<p>This castle belonged to the water-sprite who
owned the well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;">
<img src="images/i_b_132fp.jpg" width="438" height="600" alt="fairy leaning over two children sitting at table" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>The little brother and sister went up to the
castle and knocked at the door, and at once the
water-sprite opened it to them.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in,” said she. “I saw you
playing on the edge of the well, and it was I who
caused you to fall in. I am lonely here, so you
shall stay with me and be my servants, and whatever
I bid you do that you must do.”</p>

<p>The water-sprite would have been beautiful if
only she had not been so green. Her face was
green and her hair was green, and her eyes were
green. Only her teeth were white.</p>

<p>The sprite led the children into the kitchen and
there she gave the little girl a bucket that had no
bottom. “Go,” said she, “and fetch me some
water to boil the dumplings for supper. And
you,” said she to the boy, “must cut me some
wood,” and she gave him an ax that had no edge.
It was as blunt as a hammer.</p>

<p>The little sister went out to the spring that the
water-sprite showed her, and tried to dip up water,
but as fast as she dipped it up it ran out again, for
the bucket had no bottom.</p>

<p>The brother began to chop at a tree near by. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
chopped and he chopped and he chopped, but he
could scarcely make a dent, the ax was so blunt.</p>

<p>When the children came back to the castle without
either wood or water, the sprite was very
cross with them. “I can easily see that you are
both very stupid,” said she. “But sit down;
sit down at the table. Even if you are stupid I
suppose you must eat.”</p>

<p>The children sat down at the table, and the
water-sprite set before them a dish of dumplings,
but as the dumplings had not been cooked and
were only dough the children could not eat them.
They slipped them into their pockets, and then,
when the sprite was not looking they gave the
dumplings to the water-cat that rubbed about
their chairs.</p>

<p>After that the children went to bed and slept.</p>

<p>The next day it was the same thing over again.
The water-sprite set them tasks that they could
not possibly do, and gave them only dough to eat,
so the children made up their minds to run away.
They waited, however, until afternoon, when the
water-sprite went up to the top of the well to look
about her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were about to set out, the water-cat
said to them, “You do well to run away. You
would not be happy here. But do not think my
mistress will allow you to escape if she can help it.
When she comes home and finds you gone, she
will at once set out in pursuit of you. She can go
very much faster than you, and she will certainly
catch you unless you take with you her comb, her
brush, and her mirror. These are magic things.
Each time you find she is about to catch you, throw
one or other of these things over your shoulder.
By this means, and by this means only, can you
hope to escape.”</p>

<p>The children thanked the little cat, and did as it
advised them. They took the water-sprite’s brush
and comb and mirror, and carried them off with
them, and ran as fast as they could along the road
that led to the upper world.</p>

<p>Soon after they had left, the water-sprite came
home. When she found them gone she only
stopped long enough to scold the cat, and then she
put on her shoes of swiftness and started after
them.</p>

<p>Presently the children looked behind them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
saw her coming. She came so fast on her shoes
of swiftness, that it seemed as though they could
not possibly escape her.</p>

<p>However, the children remembered what the
water-cat had told them. They threw the comb
behind them, and at once it spread and grew into
a wall of spikes, tremendously stiff and high. It
took the water-sprite a long time to climb over
this wall, and the children were well on their way
before they heard her behind them again.</p>

<p>Then the little girl threw the brush over her
shoulder. At once the brush became a great thick
forest, through which the water-sprite could
hardly find her way.</p>

<p>But she got through it at last, and then it did not
take her long to be at their heels again.</p>

<p>“And now we have only one more thing left,”
said the brother, and he threw the mirror behind
him.</p>

<p>At once the mirror became a hill of glass so steep
and smooth that no one could possibly climb it.
The sprite tried to run up it, but no sooner had she
gone a step or so than she slipped back again.
At last, with a shriek of rage, she turned and fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
back to her castle, and that was the last of
her.</p>

<p>But the children went on their way, and the
road led them straight to the upper world and the
door of their home. After that they were always
careful to keep away from the edge of the water-sprite’s
well.</p>

<h2>STAR JEWELS</h2>


<p>A little girl once lived all alone with her old
grandmother upon the borders of a forest. They
were so poor that they were scarcely able to buy
food for their mouths, or clothes to cover them.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Granny,” the little girl would say.
“Some day I will be big enough to work, and then
I will earn so much that I will be able to buy everything
that we need, and to give something to
other poor folk as well.”</p>

<p>One day the child went off into the forest to
gather fagots. These she hoped to sell for a few
pennies in the town over beyond the hill. She
was to be gone all day, so she took with her into
the forest a bit of the black bread, which was all
they had left to eat.</p>

<p>It was winter, and the air was bitterly cold.
The child wrapped her little shawl about her, and
ran on as fast as she could. She was hungry, but
she intended to save her crust until after the fagots
were gathered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as she reached the edge of the forest she
met a boy, even smaller than she herself, and he
was crying bitterly.</p>

<p>The little girl had a tender heart. She stopped
and asked the child why he was weeping.</p>

<p>“I am weeping,” he answered, “because I am
hungry.”</p>

<p>“Have you had nothing to eat to-day?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I have had nothing, and I am like to starve, for
I know not where to go for food.”</p>

<p>The little girl sighed. “You are, perhaps,
hungrier than I,” she said, and she took the crust
from her pocket and gave it to the boy. Then she
again hurried on.</p>

<p>A little farther on, she met another child who
was even more miserable-looking than the first,
for this child seemed almost frozen with cold.
Her clothing hung about her in rags, and her skin
looked blue through the rents.</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried she, “if I had but a warm little
dress like yours! Help me, I pray of you, or I will
certainly die of cold.”</p>

<p>The good little girl was filled with pity. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
is not right,” thought she, “that I should have
both a dress and a shawl. I will give one of them
to this poor child.”</p>

<p>She took off her dress and gave it to the child,
and then wrapped the shawl closely about her
shoulders. In spite of the shawl she felt very
cold. Still she was near the place where the fagots
were to be found, and as soon as she had gathered
them she would run home again.</p>

<p>She hastened on, but when she reached the
place where the fagots were she saw an old woman
already there, gathering up the fallen wood. The
old woman was so bent and poor and miserable-looking
that the little girl’s heart ached for her.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” groaned the old woman. “How my
poor bones do ache. If I had but a shawl to wrap
about my shoulders I would not suffer so.”</p>

<p>The child thought of her own grandmother, and
of how she sometimes suffered, and she had pity
on the old woman.</p>

<p>“Here,” said she, “take my shawl”; and slipping
it from her shoulders she gave it to the old
woman.</p>

<p>And now she stood there in the forest with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
arms and shoulders bare, and with nothing on her
but her little shift. The sharp wind blew about
her, but she was not cold. She had eaten nothing,
but she was not hungry. She was fed and warmed
by her own kindness.</p>

<p>She gathered her fagots and started home again.
It was growing dusk, and the stars shown through
the bare branches of the trees. Suddenly an old
man stood beside her. “Give me of your fagots,”
said he, “for my hearth is cold, and I am too old to
gather wood for myself.”</p>

<p>The little girl sighed. If she gave him the
fagots she would have to stop to gather more.
Still she would not refuse him. “Take them,”
she said, “in heaven’s name.”</p>

<p>No sooner had she said this than she saw it was
not an old man who stood before her, but a shining
angel.</p>

<p>“You have fed the hungry,” said the angel,
“you have clothed the naked, and you have
given help to those who asked it. You shall not go
unrewarded. See!”</p>

<p>At once a light shone around the child, and it
seemed to her that all the stars of heaven were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
falling through the bare branches of the trees,
but these stars were diamonds and rubies and
other precious stones. They lay thick upon the
ground. “Gather them together,” said the angel,
“for they are yours.”</p>

<p>Wondering, the child gathered them together—all
that she could carry in the skirt of her little
shift.</p>

<p>When she looked about her again the angel was
gone, but the child hastened home with her treasure.
It was enough to make her and her old
grandmother rich. From then on they lacked for
nothing. They were not only able to have all they
wished for, but to give to many who were poor.
So they were not only rich, but beloved by all who
knew them.</p>

<h2>SWEET PORRIDGE</h2>


<p>There was once a poor widow who had only one
daughter, a child who was so good and gentle that
everyone who knew her, loved her.</p>

<p>One day the child went into the forest to gather
firewood, and she was very sad because there was
nothing left in the house to eat, and because she
and her mother were so often obliged to go hungry.</p>

<p>She had already gathered a bundle of sticks, and
was about to go home, when she saw a poor old
woman who had also come to the forest for wood.
The woman was so bent and stiff that it was pitiful
to see her. The child felt sorry for her and wished
to help her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good mother,” said she, “let me gather the
wood for you; it must be hard for you to stoop.”</p>

<p>She put down her own load, and gathered for
the old woman as much as she was able to carry.
“I would take it home for you,” said the little girl,
“but my mother is waiting for me, and I must make
haste, for I am already late.”</p>

<p>“Child,” said the old woman, “you have a good
heart, and you deserve to be rewarded.” She
then drew out from under her cloak a little iron
pot. “Take this,” she said. “It is a magic pot.
Whenever you are hungry you have only to say—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘Boil little pot</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the porridge is hot,’</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">and it will begin to boil and fill up with sweet porridge.
When you have had enough say—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘Cease little pot,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The porridge is hot,’</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">and it will stop boiling.”</p>

<p>She made the child repeat the words after her
several times, and she then gave her the pot and
hobbled away through the forest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The child was filled with joy at the thought that
now she and her mother need never be hungry
again. She ran home as fast as she could, carrying
the pot with both hands.</p>

<p>When she came in her mother asked her where
the wood was.</p>

<p>“I have brought home something better than
wood,” cried the child. “The wood only warms
us, but here is something that will feed us as well.”
She set the pot upon the table and said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Boil little pot</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till the porridge is hot.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The pot at once began to bubble and boil, and
soon it was full and brimming over with sweet
porridge. The widow caught up a spoon and
dipped some of the porridge out into a bowl, but
the more she dipped out the more there was in it.
When all the bowls in the house were full, the child
said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Cease little pot,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The porridge is hot,”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">and at once the pot stopped boiling.</p>

<p>The widow was overjoyed at the treasure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
little girl had brought home. “Come,” cried she,
“let us sit down and eat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear mother,” said the child, “but first I
will carry some of the porridge to the neighbors
who were so kind to us when we had nothing.”</p>

<p>She filled a large kettle with porridge and started
out with it, but no sooner had she gone than the
widow began to wonder whether they had kept
enough for themselves. She did not feel satisfied,
so she said to the pot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Boil little pot</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Till the porridge is hot.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Immediately the pot began to bubble and boil.
Soon it was full and the porridge began to run over.
The widow wished to stop it, but she had forgotten
what to say. “Enough!” she cried.
“Stop! Stop!” but the porridge still boiled up
and over the edge of the pot. The widow caught
up the spoon and again began dipping out the
porridge; she dipped as fast as she could. Soon
all the pots and pans in the house were full and
still the pot continued to boil out porridge. In
despair the widow seized the pot and threw it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
outside the door, but the porridge flowed out from
it in a stream, and ran down the road.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/i_b_150.jpg" width="363" height="269" alt="woman holding pot boiling over" />
</div>

<p>The little girl was coming home when she met
the stream of porridge, and at once she guessed
what had happened. She ran as fast as she could
and when she came to the place where the pot
lay she cried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Cease little pot,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The porridge is hot.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At once the pot stopped boiling, but already
enough porridge had been wasted to have fed the
whole countryside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>After that the widow never again dared to tell
the pot to boil. When they wished for porridge it
was the child who spoke to it. But from then on
she and her mother never lacked for anything,
for the porridge was so delicious that people came
from far and near to buy from them.</p>

<h2>CHICKEN-DIDDLE</h2>


<p>One day Chicken-diddle had gone to sleep
under a rose-bush, and a cow reached over the
fence and bit off the top of the rose-bush. The
noise wakened Chicken-diddle, and just as she
woke a rose-leaf fell on her tail.</p>

<p>“Squawk! Squawk!” cried Chicken-diddle,
“the sky’s falling down”; and away she ran as fast
as her legs would carry her. She ran until she
came to the barnyard, and there was Hen-pen
rustling in the dust of the barnyard.</p>

<p>“Oh, Hen-pen, don’t rustle—run, run!” cried
Chicken-diddle. “The sky’s falling down.”</p>

<p>The hen stopped rustling. “How do you know
that Chicken-diddle?” asked Hen-pen.</p>

<p>“I saw it with my eyes, I heard it with my ears,
and part of it fell on my tail. Oh, let us run, run,
until we get some place.”</p>

<p>“Quawk! Quawk,” cried the hen, and she began
to run, and Chicken-diddle ran after her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>They ran till they came to the duck-pond, and
there was Duck-luck just going in for a swim.</p>

<p>“Oh, Duck-luck! Duck-luck! don’t try to
swim,” cried Hen-pen. “The sky’s falling down.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Hen-pen?” asked
Duck-luck.</p>

<p>“Chicken-diddle told me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Chicken-diddle?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I know it? I saw it with my
eyes, I heard it with my ears, and part of it fell
on my tail. Oh, let us run, run until we get some
place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we had better run,” quacked Duck-luck,
and away he waddled with Hen-pen, and Chicken-diddle
after him.</p>

<p>They ran and ran till they came to a green
meadow, and there was Goose-loose eating the
green grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, Goose-loose, Goose-loose, don’t eat; run,
run,” cried Duck-luck.</p>

<p>“Why should I run?” asked Goose-loose.</p>

<p>“Because the sky’s falling down.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Duck-luck?”</p>

<p>“Hen-pen told me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know that, Hen-pen?”</p>

<p>“Chicken-diddle told me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Chicken-diddle?”</p>

<p>“Because I saw it with my eyes, and heard it
with my ears, and part of it fell on my tail. Oh,
let us run, run some place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better run,” cried Goose-loose.</p>

<p>Away they all ran, Goose-loose at the head of
them, and they ran and ran until they came to the
turkey-yard, and there was Turkey-lurkey strutting
and gobbling.</p>

<p>“Oh, Turkey-lurkey! don’t strut! Don’t strut!”
cried Goose-loose.</p>

<p>“Why should I not strut?” asked Turkey-lurkey.</p>

<p>“Because the sky’s falling down.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it is?”</p>

<p>“Duck-luck told me!”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Duck-luck?”</p>

<p>“Hen-pen told me!”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Hen-pen?”</p>

<p>“Chicken-diddle told me!”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Chicken-diddle?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help knowing! I saw it with my
eyes, I heard it with my ears, and a part of it fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
on my tail. Oh, let us run, run until we get some
place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’d better run,” said Turkey-lurkey,
so away they all ran, first Turkey-lurkey, and then
Goose-loose, and then Duck-luck, and then Hen-pen,
and then Chicken-diddle.</p>

<p>They ran and ran until they came to Fox-lox’s
house, and there was Fox-lox lying in the doorway
and yawning until his tongue curled up in his
mouth. When he saw Turkey-lurkey and Goose-loose
and Duck-luck and Hen-pen and Chicken-diddle
he stopped yawning, and pricked up his
ears, and he was very glad to see them.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said he, “and what brings you all
here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Fox-lox, Fox-lox, don’t yawn,” cried
Turkey-lurkey, “the sky’s falling down.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Turkey-lurkey?” asked
the fox.</p>

<p>“Goose-loose told me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Goose-loose?”</p>

<p>“Duck-luck told me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Duck-luck?”</p>

<p>“Hen-pen told me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“How do you know that, Hen-pen?”</p>

<p>“Chicken-diddle told me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that, Chicken-diddle?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help knowing, for I saw it with my
eyes, and I heard it with my ears, and part of it
fell on my tail. Oh, where shall we run? We
ought to go some place.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Fox, “you come right in here,
and I’ll take such good care of you that even if the
sky falls down you won’t know anything about it.”</p>

<p>So in ran Turkey-lurkey, and Fox-lox put him
in the big room, and shut the door. In ran Goose-loose,
and he put him in the little room, and shut
the door. In ran Duck-luck, and he put him in the
cellar, and shut the door. In ran Hen-pen, and he
put her in the attic, and shut the door. In ran
Chicken-diddle, and Fox-lox kept him right there
in the room with him. And what happened to them
after that I don’t know, but nobody ever saw them
again; if the sky really fell, I never heard about it.
They were only a pack of silly fowls, anyway.</p>

<h2>A PACK OF RAGAMUFFINS</h2>


<p>“My dear,” said the cock to the hen one day,
“what do you say to our taking a walk over to
Mulberry Hill? The mulberries must be ripe by
now, and we can have a fine feast.”</p>

<p>“That would suit me exactly,” answered the
hen. “I am very fond of ripe fruit, and it is a long
time since I have tasted any.” So the cock and
hen set off together.</p>

<p>The way was long, and the day was hot, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the two had reached the top of the hill they
were both of them tired and out of breath. The
mulberries lay thick on the ground, and the cock
and the hen ran about hither and yon, pecking and
eating—pecking and eating, until they could eat no
more, and the sun was near setting.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” groaned the hen, “how weary I
am. How in the world are we to get home again.
My legs are so tired, I could not go another step
if my life depended on it.”</p>

<p>“My dear,” said the cock, “I too am weary,
but I see here a number of fallen twigs. If I could
but weave them into a coach we might ride home
in comfort.”</p>

<p>“That is a clever thought,” sighed the hen.
“Make it by all means. There is nothing I like
better than riding in a coach.”</p>

<p>The cock at once set to work, and by weaving
sticks and grasses together he made a little coach
with body, wheels, and shafts all complete.</p>

<p>The hen was delighted. She at once hopped
into the coach, and seated herself. “Now, my
dear Cock-a-lorum,” she cried, “nothing more is
needed but for you to get between the shafts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
step out briskly, and we will be at home in less
than no time.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked the cock
sharply. “I have no idea of pulling the coach
myself. My legs ache as well as yours, and if you
wait for me to pull you home you may sit there
till doomsday.”</p>

<p>“But how then are we to get home?” asked the
hen, beginning to weep.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” answered the cock. “But
what I do know is that I am not going to pull you.”</p>

<p>“But you must pull me,” wept the hen.</p>

<p>“But I won’t pull you,” stormed the cock.</p>

<p>So they scolded and disputed and there is no
knowing how it would have ended, but suddenly
a duck appeared from behind some bushes.</p>

<p>When the duck saw the hen and the cock it
ruffled up its feathers and waddled toward them,
quacking fiercely. “What is this! What is this!”
cried the duck. “Do you not know that this hill
belongs to me? Be off at once or I will give you a
sound beating.”</p>

<p>It flew at the cock with outspread wings. The
cock, however, was a brave little fellow. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of running away he met the duck valiantly, and
seizing it he pulled out a beakful of feathers. The
hen shrieked, but the cock continued to punish the
duck until it cried for mercy.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the cock, settling his feathers.
“I will let you go this time, but only if you will
promise to draw our coach to the nearest inn, where
we can spend the night.”</p>

<p>The duck was afraid to refuse the cock’s demand.
He put himself between the shafts, the cock
mounted the coach and cracked his whip, and away
they all went as fast as the duck could waddle. The
coach rocked and bumped over the stones, and suddenly
the duck gave a jump that almost upset it.
“Ouch! ouch!” it cried. “Something stuck me.”</p>

<p>“I do well to stick you,” replied a small sharp
voice. “I may teach you to look where you are
going, and not step on honest travelers who are
smaller than you.”</p>

<p>The voice was that of a needle, who, with a pin
for a comrade, was journeying along the same road.</p>

<p>The cock looked out from the coach. “I am
sorry,” said he, “that my duck should be so careless.
Will you not get in and ride with us?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>This the pin and the needle were glad to do.
The hen was somewhat nervous at first, lest one of
them might tread on her foot, but they were so
polite, and so careful not to crowd her, that she soon
lost her fear of them.</p>

<p>Just before nightfall the coach reached the door
of an inn. Here the duck stopped, and the cock
called loudly for the landlord.</p>

<p>The man came running, but when he saw the
strange guests that sat in the coach he almost
shut the door on them. “We want no ragamuffins
here,” he cried.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” cried the cock. “Just see this
fine white egg that the hen has laid. And every
morning the duck lays an egg also. Both of these
shall be yours if you will take us in for the
night.”</p>

<p>Well, the landlord was willing to agree to that
bargain. He bade the companions enter and make
themselves comfortable. This they did, eating
and drinking to their hearts’ content. Then the
cock and the hen made themselves comfortable in
the best bed, and the others tucked themselves
away as best they could.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as they were all asleep the landlord said
to his wife, “Listen! This is a fine bargain that I
have made. Roast duck is very good, and so is
chicken pie, and to-morrow our travelers shall
furnish us with both of them. As for the needle
and pin you can put them away in your work-basket,
and they will always be useful.”</p>

<p>After saying this the landlord and his wife also
went to sleep, for the landlord intended to be
up early in the morning before his guests had
wakened.</p>

<p>The cock, however, was not one to let anyone
catch him sleeping. While it was still dark the
next morning, he awakened the hen. “Come,”
said he; “we’d best be up and away. This
landlord of ours seems to me a sly and greedy man;
he might take a notion to have roast chicken for
dinner to-day, so we had better be gone before he
is stirring.”</p>

<p>To this the hen agreed, but she and the cock were
both hungry, so before starting they shared the
egg between them. The shells they threw in
among the ashes on the hearth. Then they took
the needle and stuck it in the back of the landlord’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
chair; the pin they put in the towel that
hung behind the door, and this done they took to
their wings and away they flew.</p>

<p>The sound of their going awoke the duck. It
opened its eyes and looked after them. “Well,
well! So they’re off. I think I’d better be moving
myself,” and so saying it waddled down to
the river, and swam back to the place whence it
had come.</p>

<p>It was not long after this the landlord himself
awoke. “I’ll just slip down and see to the travelers
before breakfast,” said he.</p>

<p>“Do,” answered his wife.</p>

<p>First, however, the landlord stopped to wash in
the kitchen. He picked up the towel to dry his face,
and the pin that was in it scratched him from ear
to ear. He went to the hearth to light his pipe
and the egg-shells flew up in his face. He sat
down in his chair for a moment, but scarcely had he
leaned back, when he jumped up with a cry. The
needle had run into him.</p>

<p>“It is all the fault of those ragamuffins,” cried
the landlord in a rage, and he caught up a knife
and ran to find them. But search as he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
there was not a sign of them anywhere, for they
were already safely home again.</p>

<p>So all the landlord had for his trouble after all,
was his pains.</p>

<h2>THE FROG PRINCE</h2>


<p>There was once a king who had one only daughter,
and her he loved as he loved the apple of his
eye.</p>

<p>One day the Princess sat beside a fountain in
the gardens, and played with a golden ball. She
threw it up into the air and caught it again, and the
ball shone and glittered in the sunshine so that
she laughed aloud with pleasure. But presently
as she caught at the ball she missed it, and it
rolled across the grass and fell into the fountain.
There it sank to the bottom. The Princess tried
and tried to reach it, but she could not. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
began to weep, and her tears dripped down into the
fountain.</p>

<p>“Princess, Princess, why are you weeping?”
asked a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>The Princess looked about her, and there was a
great squat green frog sitting on the edge of the
fountain.</p>

<p>“I am weeping, Froggie, because I have dropped
my ball into the water and I cannot get it again,”
answered the Princess.</p>

<p>“And what will you give me if I get it for you?”</p>

<p>“Anything in the world, dear Frog, except the
ball itself.”</p>

<p>“I wish you to give me nothing, Princess,” said
the frog. “But if I bring back your ball to you
will you let me be your little playmate? Will you let
me sit at your table, and eat from your plate, and
drink from your mug, and sleep in your little
bed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” cried the Princess. She was very
willing to promise, for she did not believe the frog
could ever leave the fountain, or come up the
palace steps.</p>

<p>“Very well, then that is a promise,” said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
frog, and at once he plunged into the fountain
and brought back the ball to the Princess in his
arms.</p>

<p>The little girl took the ball and ran away with
it without even stopping to thank him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/i_b_167.jpg" width="265" height="300" alt="frog standing on hind legs wearing crown" />
</div>

<p>That evening the child sat at supper with her
father, and she ate from her golden plate, and
drank from her golden mug, and she did not even
give a thought to the frog down in the fountain.</p>

<p>Presently there came a knocking at the door,
but it was so soft that no one heard it but the
Princess. Then the knocking came again, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
hoarse voice cried, “King’s daughter, King’s
daughter, let me in. Have you forgotten the promise
you made me by the fountain?”</p>

<p>The Princess was frightened. She slipped down
from her chair, and ran to the door, and opened it
and looked out. There on the top-most step sat
the great green frog.</p>

<p>When the Princess saw him she shut the door
quickly, and came back to the table, and she was
very pale.</p>

<p>“Who was that at the door?” asked the King.</p>

<p>“It was no one,” answered the Princess.</p>

<p>“But there was surely someone there,” said the
King.</p>

<p>“It was only a great green frog from the fountain,”
said the Princess. And then she told her
father how she had dropped her ball into the
fountain, and how the frog had brought it back to
her, and of what she had promised him.</p>

<p>“What you have promised that you must perform,”
said the King. “Open the door, my daughter,
and let him in.”</p>

<p>Very unwillingly the child went back to the door
and opened it; the frog hopped into the room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
When she returned to the table, the frog hopped
along close at her heels.</p>

<p>She sat down and began to eat. “King’s
daughter, King’s daughter, set me upon the table
that I too may eat from your golden plate,” said
the frog.</p>

<p>The Princess would have refused, but she dared
not because of what her father had said. She
lifted the frog to the table, and there he ate
from her plate, but she herself could touch
nothing.</p>

<p>“I am thirsty,” said the frog. “Tilt your
golden mug that I may drink from it.”</p>

<p>The Princess did as he bade her, but as she did
so she could not help weeping so that her tears
ran down into the milk.</p>

<p>When supper was ended the Princess was about
to hurry away to her room, but the frog called to
her, “King’s daughter, King’s daughter, take me
along. Have you forgotten that I was to sleep
in your little white bed?”</p>

<p>“That you shall not,” cried the Princess in a
passion. “Go back to the stones of the fountain,
where you belong.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you have said that you must do,” said
the King. “Take the frog with you.”</p>

<p>The Princess shuddered, but she dared not
refuse.</p>

<p>She took the frog with her up to her room, and
put him down in the darkest corner, where she
would not see him. Then she undressed and
went to bed. But scarcely had her head touched
the pillow when she heard the frog calling her.</p>

<p>“King’s daughter, King’s daughter! Is this the
way you keep your promise? Lift me up to the
bed, for the floor is cold and hard.”</p>

<p>The Princess sprang from the bed and seized
the frog in her hands. “Miserable frog,” she
cried, “you shall not torment me in this way.”
So saying she threw the frog against the wall with
all her force.</p>

<p>But no sooner did the frog touch the wall than
it turned into a handsome young prince, all dressed
in green, with a golden crown upon his head, and a
chain of emeralds about his neck.</p>

<p>The Prince came to her, and took her by the
hand.</p>

<p>“Dear Princess,” said he, “you have broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the enchantment that held me. A cruel fairy was
angry with my father, and so she changed me into
a frog, and put me there in the fountain. But now
that the enchantment is broken we can really be
playmates, and when you are old enough you shall
be my wife.”</p>

<p>The Princess did not say no. She was delighted
at the thought of having such a handsome playmate.
And as for marrying him later on, she was
quite willing for that, too.</p>

<p>So the Prince stayed there in the palace, and the
King was very glad to think he was to have him
for a son-in-law, and when he and the Princess
were married, there was great rejoicing and feasting
through all the kingdom.</p>

<p>The Prince, however, was not willing to stay away
from his own kingdom any longer. He said he
must return to see his old father.</p>

<p>One day a handsome golden coach drawn by
eight white horses drove up to the door. It had
been sent by the Prince’s father to fetch him home
again. Upon the box rode the faithful servant who
had cared for the Prince when he was a child.</p>

<p>When the Prince had been carried away by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
fairy this faithful servant had grieved so bitterly
he had feared his heart would break. To keep
this from happening he had put three great iron
bands around his body.</p>

<p>The Prince and the Princess entered the coach,
and away went the horses. They had not driven
far, however, when a loud crack was heard.</p>

<p>“What is that?” cried the Princess. “Surely
something has broken.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mistress,” answered the faithful servant,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It was a band that bound my heart.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My joy hath broken it apart.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They drove a little farther, and then there came
another crack, even louder than the first.</p>

<p>“Surely the coach is breaking down,” cried the
Prince.</p>

<p>“Nay, master,” answered the faithful servant,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“’Tis but my joy that rives apart</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The second band that held my heart.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A little farther on there came a crack that was
louder than any.</p>

<p>“Now surely something has broken,” cried the
Prince and Princess together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“’Tis the last band that held my heart,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And joy has riven all apart,”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="unindent">answered the servant.</p>

<p>After that they drove on quietly until they
reached their own country. There the Prince and
Princess lived in happiness to the end of their lives,
and the faithful servant with them.</p>

<h2>THE WOLF AND THE FIVE LITTLE GOATS</h2>


<p>There was once a mother goat who had five
little kids, and these kids were so dear to her that
nothing could have been dearer.</p>

<p>One day the mother goat was going to the forest
to gather some wood for her fire. “Now, my little
kids,” said she, “you must be very careful while
I am away. Bar the door behind me, and open
it to nobody until I return. If the wicked wolf
should get in he would certainly eat you.”</p>

<p>The little kids promised they would be careful,
and then their mother started out, and as soon as
she had gone they barred the door behind her.</p>

<p>Now it so happened the old wolf was on the
watch that day. He saw the mother goat trotting
away toward the forest, and as soon as she was out
of sight, he crept down to the house and knocked
at the door—rap-tap-tap!</p>

<p>“Who is there?” called the little kids within.</p>

<p>“It is I, your mother, my dears,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the wolf in his great rough voice. “Open the door
and let me in.”</p>

<p>But the kids were very clever little kids. “No,
no,” they cried. “You are not our mother. Our
mother has a soft, sweet voice, and your voice is
harsh and rough. You must be the wolf.”</p>

<p>When the wolf heard this he was very angry.
He battered and battered at the door, but they
would not let him in. Then he turned and galloped
away as fast as he could until he came to a dairy.
There he stuck his head in at the window, and the
woman had just finished churning her butter.</p>

<p>“Woman, woman,” cried the wolf, “give me
some butter. If you do not I will come in and
upset your churn.”</p>

<p>The woman was frightened. At once she gave
him a great deal of butter—all he could eat.</p>

<p>The wolf swallowed it down, and then he ran
back to the goat’s house and knocked at the door—rat-tat-rat!</p>

<p>“Who is there?” asked the little goats within.</p>

<p>“Your mother, my dears,” answered the wolf,
and now his voice was very soft and smooth because
of the butter he had swallowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> our mother,” cried the little kids, and they
were about to open the door, but the littlest kid of
all, who was a very wise little kid, stopped them.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said he. “It sounds like our
mother’s voice, but before we open the door we
had better be very, very sure it is not the wolf.”
Then he called through the door, “Put your paws
up on the windowsill.”</p>

<p>The wolf suspected nothing. He put his paws
up on the windowsill, and as soon as the little kids
saw them they knew at once that it was not their
mother. “No, no,” they cried, “you are not our
mother. Our mother has pretty white feet, and
your feet are as black as soot. You must be the
wolf.”</p>

<p>When the wolf heard this he was angrier than
ever. He turned and galloped away again, and as
he galloped he growled to himself and gnashed
his teeth.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a baker’s shop, and there
he stuck his head in at the window.</p>

<p>“Baker, baker, give me some dough,” he cried.
“If you do not I will upset your pans and spoil
your baking.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>The baker was frightened. At once he gave
the wolf all the dough he wanted. The wolf
seized it and ran away with it. He ran until he
came to the goat’s house. There he sat down
and covered his black feet all over with the white
dough. Then he knocked at the door—rat-tat-tat!</p>

<p>“Who is there?” cried the little goats within.</p>

<p>“Your mother, my dears, come home again,”
answered the wolf, in his smooth buttery voice.</p>

<p>“Put your paws up on the windowsill.”</p>

<p>The wolf put his paws up on the windowsill,
and they looked quite white because of the dough.
Then the little kids felt sure it was their mother,
and they gladly opened the door.</p>

<p>“Woof!” In bounded the wicked wolf.</p>

<p>The little goats cried out and away they ran,
some in one direction, and some in another. They
hid themselves one behind the door, and one in the
dough-trough, and one in the wash-tub, and one
under the bed, and one (and he was the littlest one
of all) hid in the tall clock-case. The wolf stood
there glaring about him, and not as much as a tail
of one of them could he see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he began to hunt about for them, but he
had to be in a hurry, because he was afraid the
mother goat would come home again.</p>

<p>He found the kid behind the door, and he was
in such a hurry he swallowed it whole without
hurting it in the least. He found the one in the
wash-tub, and he swallowed it whole, too. He found
the one in the dough-trough, and it, too, he
swallowed whole. He found the one under the
bed and he swallowed it whole. The only one he
did not find was the one in the clock-case, and
he never thought of looking there. He hunted
around and hunted around, and he was afraid to
stay any longer for fear their mother would come
home.</p>

<p>But now the old wolf felt very heavy and sleepy.
He looked around for a place to go in order to lie
down and rest.</p>

<p>Not far away were some rocks and trees that
made a pleasant shadow. Here the wolf stretched
himself out, and presently he was snoring so loudly
that the leaves of the trees shook overhead.</p>

<p>Soon after this the mother goat came home.
As soon as she saw the door of the house standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
open, she knew at once that some misfortune had
happened. She went in and looked about her.
The furniture was all upset and scattered about
the room. “Alas, alas! My dear little kids!”
cried the mother. “The wicked wolf has certainly
been here and eaten them all.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t eat me,” said a little voice in the
clock-case.</p>

<p>The mother goat opened the door of the clock-case
and the littlest kid of all hopped out.</p>

<p>“But why were you in the clock-case? And
what has happened?” asked the mother.</p>

<p>Then the little kid told her all about how the
wolf had come there with his buttery voice and
his whitened paws, and how they had let him in,
and how he had swallowed all four of the other
little kids, so that he alone was left.</p>

<p>After the mother goat had heard the story she
went to the door and looked about. Then she
heard the old wolf snoring where he lay asleep
under the nut-trees in the shade of the rocks.</p>

<p>“That must be the old wolf snoring,” said the
mother goat, “and he cannot be far away. Do
not make a noise, my little kid, but come with me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother goat stole over to the heap of rocks,
and the little kid followed her on tiptoes. She
peeped and peered, and there lay the old wolf so
fast asleep that nothing less than an earthquake
would have wakened him.</p>

<p>“Now, my little kid,” whispered the mother,
“run straight home again as fast as you can, and
fetch me my shears and a needle and some stout
thread.”</p>

<p>This the little kid did, and he ran so softly over
the grass that not even a mouse could have heard
him.</p>

<p>As soon as he returned the mother goat crept
up to the old wolf, and with the sharp shears she
slit his hide up just as though it had been a sack.
Out popped one little kid, and out popped another
little kid, and another, and another, and there they
all were, just as safe and sound as though they
had never been swallowed. And all this while
the old wolf never stirred nor stopped snoring.</p>

<p>“And now, my little kids,” whispered the
mother, “do you each one of you bring me a big
round stone, but be very quick and quiet, for your
lives depend upon it.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>So the little kids ran away, and hunted around,
and each fetched her back a big round stone, and
they were very quick and quiet about it, just as their
mother had bade them be.</p>

<p>The old goat put the stones inside the wolf,
where the little kids had been, and then she drew
the hide together and sewed it up, using the stout,
strong thread. After that she and the little kids
hid themselves behind the rocks, and watched and
waited.</p>

<p>Presently the old wolf yawned and opened his
eyes. Then he got up and shook himself, and
when he did so the stones inside him rattled together
so that the goat and the little kids could
hear them, where they hid behind the rocks.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear me!” groaned the wolf;</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Not little goats, I fear, but only big stones.”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now what with the stones inside of him and the
hot sun overhead the wolf grew very thirsty. Near
by was a deep well, with water almost up to the
brink of it. The old wolf went to drink. He
leaned over, and all the stones rolled up to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
head and upset him. Plump! he went down into
the water, and the stones carried him straight to
the bottom. He could not swim at all, and so he
was drowned.</p>

<p>But all the little kids ran out from behind the
rocks and began to dance around the well.</p>

<h2>THE GOLDEN GOOSE</h2>


<p>There was once an honest laborer who had three
sons. The two eldest were stout clever lads, but
as to the youngest one, John, he was little better
than a simpleton.</p>

<p>One day their mother wanted some wood from
the forest, and it was the eldest lad who was to go
and get it for her. It was a long way to the forest,
so the mother filled a wallet with food for him.
There was a loaf of fine white bread, and a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
cheese, and a leathern bottle of good red wine as
well.</p>

<p>The lad set off and walked along and walked
along and after awhile he came to the place where
he was going, and there under a tree sat an old,
old man. His clothes were gray, and his hair
was gray, and his face was gray, so he was gray all
over.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said the lad.</p>

<p>“I am hungry,” said the gray man. “Have you
not a bite and sup that you can share with me?”</p>

<p>“Food I have, and drink too,” said the lad,
“but it is for myself, and not for you. It would be
a simple thing for me to carry it this far just to give
it to a beggar”; and he went on his way.</p>

<p>But it was bad luck the lad had that day.
Scarcely had he begun chopping wood when the head
of the ax flew off, and cut his foot so badly that
he was obliged to go limping home, with not even
so much as a fagot to carry with him.</p>

<p>The next day it was the second son who said he
would go to the forest for wood.</p>

<p>“And see that you are more careful than your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
brother,” said his mother. Then she gave him
a loaf of bread, and a bit of cheese, and a bottle of
wine, and off he set.</p>

<p>Presently he came to the forest, and there,
sitting in the same place where he had sat before,
was the old gray man.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said the lad.</p>

<p>“I am hungry,” said the gray man. “Have
you not a bite or a sup to share with me?”</p>

<p>“Food I have and drink as well, but I am not
such a simpleton as to give it away when I need
all for myself.”</p>

<p>The lad went on to the place where he was
going, and took his ax and began to chop, but
scarcely had he begun when the ax slipped and
cut his leg so badly that the blood ran, and he could
scarcely get home again.</p>

<p>That was a bad business, for now both of the
elder brothers were lame.</p>

<p>The next day the simpleton said he would go to
the forest for wood.</p>

<p>“You, indeed!” cried his mother. “It is not
enough that your two brothers are hurt? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
think you are smarter than they are? No, no; do
you stay quietly here at home. That is the best
place for you.”</p>

<p>But the simpleton was determined to go, so his
mother gave him an end of dough that was left
from the baking and a bottle of sour beer, for that
was good enough for him. With these in his
wallet John started off, and after awhile he came
to the forest, and there was the gray man sitting
just as before.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” answered the simpleton.</p>

<p>“I am hungry,” said the gray man. “Have
you not a bite or sup that you can share with me?”</p>

<p>Oh yes, the simpleton had both food and drink
in his wallet. It was none of the best, but such as
it was he was willing to share it.</p>

<p>He reached into his wallet and pulled out the
piece of dough, but what was his surprise to find
that it was dough no longer, but a fine cake, all
made of the whitest flour. The old man snatched
the cake from John and ate it all up in a trice.
There was not so much as a crumb of it left.</p>

<p>“Poor pickings for me!” said John.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the old gray man was thirsty. “What
have you in that bottle?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was only sour beer.”</p>

<p>The old man took the bottle and opened it.
“Sour beer! Why it is wine,” he cried, “and
of the very best, too.”</p>

<p>And the simpleton could tell it was by the smell
of it. But the smell of it was all he got, for the old
man raised the bottle to his lips, and when he
put it down there was not a drop left in it.</p>

<p>“And now I may go thirsty as well as hungry,”
said John.</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” said the old man. “After
this you may eat and drink of the best whenever
you will. Go on into the forest and take the first
turning to the right. There you will see a hollow
oak tree. Cut it down, and whatever you find
inside of it you may keep; it belongs to me, and
it is I who give it to you.”</p>

<p>Then of a sudden the old man was gone, and
where he went the simpleton could have told
no one.</p>

<p>The lad went on into the forest, as the gray man
had told him, and took the first turn to the left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and there sure enough was a hollow oak tree.
The lad could tell it was hollow from the sound it
made when his ax struck it.</p>

<p>John set to work, and chopped so hard the
splinters flew.</p>

<p>After awhile he cut through it so that the tree
fell, and there, sitting in the hollow, was a goose,
with eyes like diamonds, and every feather of pure
gold.</p>

<p>When John saw the goose he could not wonder
enough. He took it up under his arm and off he
set for home, for there was no more chopping for
him that day.</p>

<p>But if the goose shone like gold it weighed like
lead. The farther John went the wearier he
grew. After awhile he came to an inn, just outside
of the city where the King lived. There the
simpleton sat him down to rest. He pulled a feather
from the golden goose, and gave it to the
landlord and bade him bring him food and drink,
and with such payment as that it was the very
best that the landlord sat before him you may be
sure.</p>

<p>While the simpleton ate and drank the landlord’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
wife and daughter watched him from a
window.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we only had a second feather,” sighed
the daughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, if we only had!” sighed the mother.</p>

<p>Then the two agreed between them that when
the simpleton had finished eating and drinking,
the daughter should creep up behind him and
pluck another feather from the bird.</p>

<p>Presently John could eat and drink no more.
He rose up and tucked the golden goose under his
arm, and off he set.</p>

<p>The landlord’s daughter was watching, and she
stole up behind him and caught hold of a feather
in the goose’s tail. No sooner had she touched it,
however, than her fingers stuck, and she could not
let go. Off marched John with the goose under his
arm, and the girl tagging along after him.</p>

<p>The mother saw her following John down the
road, and first she called, and then she shouted,
and then she ran after her and caught hold of her
to bring her home. But no sooner had she laid
hands on the girl than she, too, stuck, and was
obliged to follow John and the golden goose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The landlord was looking from the window.
“Wife, wife,” he cried, “where are you going?”
And he hurried after her and caught her by the
sleeve. Then he could not let go any more than
the others.</p>

<p>The simpleton marched along with the three
tagging at his heels, and he never so much as
turned his head to look over his shoulder at
them.</p>

<p>The road ran past a church, and there was the
clergyman just coming out of the door. “Stop,
stop!” he cried to the landlord. “Have you forgotten
you have a christening feast to cook to-day?”
And he ran after the landlord and caught
hold of him, and then he too stuck.</p>

<p>The sexton saw his master following the landlord,
and he ran and caught hold of his coat, and
he too had to follow. So it went. Everyone who
touched those who followed the golden goose
could not let go, and were obliged to tag along at
John’s heels.</p>

<p>Now the King of that country had a daughter
who was so sad and doleful that she was never
known to smile. For this reason a gloom hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
over the whole country, and the King had promised
that any one who could make the Princess
laugh should have her as a wife and a half of the
kingdom as well.</p>

<p>It so chanced the simpleton’s way led him
through the city and by the time he came in front
of the King’s palace the whole street was in an
uproar, and John had a long train of people tagging
along after him.</p>

<p>The Princess heard the noise in the room where
she sat sighing and wiping her eyes, and as she
was very curious she went to the window and
looked out to see what all the uproar was about.</p>

<p>When she saw the simpleton marching along
with a goose under his arm and a whole string
of people after him, all crying and bawling and
calling for help, it seemed to her the funniest
thing she had ever seen. She began to laugh,
and she laughed and laughed. She laughed
until the tears ran down her cheeks and she had
to hold her sides for laughing.</p>

<p>But it was no laughing matter for the King, as
you may believe. Here was a poor common lad,
and a simpleton at that, who had made the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
laugh; so now, by all rights, he might claim her for
a wife, and the half of the kingdom, too.</p>

<p>The King frowned and bit his nails, and then he
sent for John to be brought before him, and the lad
came in alone, for he had set the people free at
the gates.</p>

<p>“Listen, now,” said the King to John. “It is
true I promised that anyone who made the Princess
laugh should have her for a wife, but there is more
to the matter than that. Before I hand over part
of the kingdom to anyone, I must know what sort of
friends he has, and whether they are good fellows.
If you can bring here a man who can drink a whole
cellar full of wine at one sitting then you shall
have the Princess and part of the kingdom, just as
promised; but if you cannot you shall be sent home
with a good drubbing to keep you quiet.”</p>

<p>When John heard that he made a wry face. He
did not know where he could find a man who could
drink a whole cellar full of wine at one sitting.</p>

<p>He went out from the castle, and suddenly he
remembered the old gray man who had given him
the golden goose. If the old man had helped him
once perhaps he might again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>He set out for the forest, and it was not long
before he came to it. There, sitting where the
old gray man had sat before, was a man with a
sad and rueful face. He looked as though he had
never smiled in all his life. He was talking to
himself, and when the simpleton drew near
he found the man was saying over and over,
“How dry I am! How dry I am! Not even the
dust of a summer’s day is as dry as I.”</p>

<p>“If you are so thirsty, friend,” said John,
“rise up and follow me. Do you think you could
drink a whole cellar full of wine at one sitting?”</p>

<p>Yes, the man could do that, and glad to get it,
too. A whole cellar full of wine would be none
too much to satisfy such a thirst as his.</p>

<p>“Then, come along,” said John.</p>

<p>He took the man back to the castle and down
into the cellar where all the casks of wine were
stored. When the man saw all that wine his eyes
sparkled with joy. He sat him down to drink, and
one after another he drained the casks until the
very last one of them was empty. Then he
stretched himself and sighed. “Now I am content,”
said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the King his eyes bulged with wonder that
any one man could drink so much at one sitting.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is all very well,” said he to the
simpleton. “I see you have a friend who can
drink. Have you also a friend who can eat a
whole mountain of bread without stopping? If
you have, you may claim the Princess for your
wife, but if you have not, then you shall be sent
home with a good drubbing.”</p>

<p>Well, that was not in the bargain, but perhaps
the simpleton might be able to find such a man.</p>

<p>He set off for the forest once more, and when
he came near the place where the thirsty man had
sat he saw there another man, and he was enough
like the thirsty man to be his brother.</p>

<p>As John came near to where he sat he heard him
talking to himself, and what he was saying over-and-over
was, “How hungry I am. Oh, how hungry
I am.”</p>

<p>“Friend,” said the simpleton, “are you hungry
enough to eat a whole mountain of bread? If
you are I may satisfy you.”</p>

<p>Yes, a whole mountain of bread would be none
too much for the hungry man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>So John bade the stranger follow him and then
he led the way back to the castle.</p>

<p>There all the flour in the kingdom had been
gathered together into one great enormous mountain
of dough. When John saw how big it was his
heart failed him.</p>

<p>“Can you eat that much?” he asked of the
hungry man.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can eat that much, and more, too, if
need be,” said the man.</p>

<p>Then he sat down before the mountain of bread
and began to eat. He ate and he ate, and he ate,
and when he finished not so much as a crumb of
bread was left.</p>

<p>As for the King he was a sad and sorry man.
Not only was his daughter and part of the kingdom
promised to a simpleton, but he had not
even a cupful of flour left in the palace for his
breakfast.</p>

<p>And still the King was not ready to keep the
promises he had made. There was one thing
more required of the simpleton before he could
have the Princess and part of the kingdom for
himself. Let him bring to the King a ship that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
would sail both on land and water, and he should
at once marry the Princess, and no more words
about it.</p>

<p>Well, John did not know about that, but he
would do the best he could. He took the road
that led back to the forest, and when he reached
the place where the old man had sat, there was
the old man sitting again just as though he had
never moved from that one spot.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the old man, “and has the golden
goose made your fortune?”</p>

<p>“That,” answered John, “is as it may be. It
may be I am to have the half of a kingdom and a
princess for a wife, and it may be that I am only
to get a good drubbing. Before I win the Princess
I must find a ship that will sail on land as well as
on water, and if there is such a thing as that in the
world I have never heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there might be harder things than that
to find,” said the old man. It might be he could
help John out of that ditch, and what was more
he would, too, and all that because John had once
been kind to him. The old man then reached in
under his coat and brought out the prettiest little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
model of a ship that ever was seen. Its sails were
of silk, its hull of silver, and its masts of beaten
gold.</p>

<p>The old man set the ship on the ground, and at
once it began to grow. It grew and grew and grew,
until it was so large that it could have carried a
score of men if need be.</p>

<p>“Look,” said the old man. “This I give to
you because you were kind to me and willing to
share the best you had. Moreover it was I who
drank the wine and ate the mountain of bread
for you. Enter into the ship and it will carry
you over land and water, and back to the King’s
castle. And when he sees this ship he will no
longer dare to refuse you the Princess for your
wife.”</p>

<p>And so it was. John stepped into the ship
and sailed away until he came to the King’s palace,
and when the King saw the ship he was so delighted
with it that he was quite willing to give
the Princess to the simpleton for a bride.</p>

<p>The marriage was held with much feasting and
rejoicing, and John’s father and mother and his
two brothers were invited to the feast. But they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
no longer called him the simpleton; instead he
was His Majesty, the wise King John.</p>

<p>As for the old gray man he was never seen again,
and as the golden goose had disappeared also,
perhaps he flew away on it.</p>

<h2>THE THREE SPINNERS</h2>


<p>There was once a girl who was so idle and lazy
that she would do nothing but sit in the sunshine
all day. She would not bake, she would not
brew, she would not spin, she would not sew.
One morning her mother lost patience with her entirely,
and gave her a good beating. The girl cried
out until she could be heard even into the street.</p>

<p>Now it so chanced the queen of the country was
driving by at that time, and she heard the cries.
She wished to find out what the trouble was, so
she stopped her coach and entered the house.
She went through one room after another, and
presently she came to where the girl and her
mother were.</p>

<p>“What is all this noise?” she asked. “Why is
your daughter crying out?”</p>

<p>The mother was ashamed to confess what a lazy
girl she had for a daughter, so she told the queen
what was not true.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, your majesty,” cried she, “this girl is
the worry of my life. She will do nothing but spin
all day, and I have spent all my money buying
flax for her. This morning she asked me for
more, but I have no money left to buy it. It was
because of that she began to cry, as you heard.”</p>

<p>The Queen was very much surprised. “This
girl of yours must be a very fine spinner,” she said.
“You must bring her to the palace, for there is
nothing I love better than spinning. Bring her to-morrow,
and if she is as wonderful a spinner as I
suspect, she shall be to me as my own daughter,
and shall have my eldest son as a husband.”</p>

<p>When the girl heard she was to go to the palace
and spin she was terrified. She had never spun
a thread in her life, and she feared that when the
Queen found this out she would be angry and
would have her punished. However, she dared
say nothing.</p>

<p>The next day she and her mother went to the
palace, and the Queen received them kindly. The
mother was sent home again, but the daughter
was taken to a tower where there were three
great rooms all filled with flax.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“See,” said the Queen. “Here is enough flax
to satisfy you for awhile at least. When you have
spun this you shall marry my son, and after that
you shall have all the flax you want. Now you
may begin, and to-morrow I will come to see how
much you have done.”</p>

<p>So saying the Queen went away, closing the door
behind her.</p>

<p>No sooner was the girl alone than she burst
into tears. Not if she lived a hundred years
could she spin all that flax. She sat and cried
and cried and cried.</p>

<p>The next morning the Queen came back to see
how much she had done. She was very much
surprised to find the flax untouched, and the girl
sitting there with idle hands. “How is this?”
she asked. “Why are you not at your spinning?”</p>

<p>The girl began to make excuses. “I was so
sad at being parted from my mother that I could
do nothing but sit and weep.”</p>

<p>“I see you have a tender heart,” said the
Queen. “But to-morrow you must begin to work.
When I come again I shall expect to see a whole
roomful done.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>After she had gone the girl began to weep again.
She did not know what was to become of her.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and three ugly old
women slipped into the room. The first had a
splayfoot. The second had a lip that hung down
on her chin. The third had a hideous broad
thumb.</p>

<p>The girl looked at them with fear and wonder.
“Who are you?” she asked.</p>

<p>The one with the splayfoot answered. “We
are three spinners. We know why you are weeping,
and we have come to help you, but before we help
you, you must promise us one thing: that is that
when you are married to the Prince, we may come
to your wedding feast, that you will let us sit at
your table, and that you will call us your aunts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; I will, I will,” cried the girl. She
was ready to promise anything if they would only
help her.</p>

<p>At once the splayfoot sat down at the wheel, and
began to spin and tread. She with the hanging
lip moistened the thread, and the woman with the
broad thumb pressed and twisted it. They worked
so fast that the thread flowed on like a swift stream.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Before the next evening they had finished the whole
roomful of flax.</p>

<p>When the Queen came again she was delighted
to find so much done. “To-morrow,” said she,
“you shall begin in the second room.”</p>

<p>The next day the girl was taken into the second
room, and it was larger than the first and was also
full of flax.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Queen left her when the door
was pushed open, and the three old women came
into the room.</p>

<p>“Remember your promise,” said they.</p>

<p>“I remember,” answered the girl.</p>

<p>The old women then took their places and began
to spin. Before the next evening they had finished
all the flax that was in the room.</p>

<p>When the Queen came to look at what had been
done, she was filled with wonder. Not only had all
the flax in the room been spun, but she had never
seen such smooth and even threads.</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” said she, “you shall spin the flax
that is in the third room, and the day after you
shall be married to my son.”</p>

<p>The third day all happened just as it had before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
The girl was taken to the third room and it was
even larger than the others. Scarcely had she
been left alone when the three old women opened
the door and came in.</p>

<p>“Remember your promise,” said they.</p>

<p>“I will remember,” answered the girl.</p>

<p>The old women took their places, and before
night all the flax was spun. Then they rose.
“To-morrow will be your wedding day, and we will
be at the feast. If you keep your word to us, all
will go well with you, but if you forget it, misfortune
will surely come upon you.” Then they
disappeared through the door as they had come,
the eldest first.</p>

<p>When the Queen came that evening she was
even more delighted than before. Never had she
seen such thread, so smooth it was and even.</p>

<p>The girl was led down from the tower and dressed
in silks and velvets and jewels, and when thus
dressed she was so beautiful that the Prince was
filled with love and joy at the sight of her. The
next day they were married, and a grand feast was
spread. To this feast all the noblest in the land
were invited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The bride sat beside her husband, and he could
look at no one else, she was so beautiful.</p>

<p>Just as the feast was about to begin the door
opened and the three old women who had spun
the flax came in.</p>

<p>The Prince looked at them wonderingly. Never
had he seen such hideous, ugly creatures before.
“Who are these?” he asked of the girl.</p>

<p>“These,” said she, “are my three old aunts,
and I have promised they shall sit at the table with
us, for they have been so kind to me that no one
could be kinder.”</p>

<p>The girl then rose, and went to meet the old
women. “Welcome, my aunts,” she said, and led
them to the table. The Prince loved the girl so dearly
that all she did seemed right to him. He commanded
that places should be put for the old women,
and they sat at the table with him and his bride.</p>

<p>They were so hideous, however, that the Prince
could not keep his eyes off them. At length he
said to the eldest, “Forgive me, good mother, but
why is your foot so broad?”</p>

<p>“From treading the thread, my son, from treading
the thread,” she answered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince wondered; he turned to the second
old woman. “And you, good mother,” he said,
“why does your lip hang down?”</p>

<p>“From wetting the thread,” she answered.
“From wetting the thread.”</p>

<p>The Prince was frightened. He spoke to the
third old woman. “And you, why is your thumb
so broad, if I may ask it?”</p>

<p>“From pressing and twisting,” she answered.
“From pressing and twisting.”</p>

<p>The Prince turned pale. “If this is what comes
of spinning,” said he, “never shall my bride touch
the flax again.”</p>

<p>And so it was. Never was the girl allowed even
to look at a spinning wheel again; and that did
not trouble her, as you may guess.</p>

<p>As for the old women, they disappeared as soon
as the feast was over, and no one saw them again,
but the bride lived happy forever after.</p>

<h2>GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS</h2>


<p>There was once a little girl whose hair was so
bright and yellow that it glittered in the sun like
spun-gold. For this reason she was called Goldilocks.</p>

<p>One day Goldilocks went out into the meadows
to gather flowers. She wandered on and on, and
after a while she came to a forest, where she had
never been before. She went on into the forest,
and it was very cool and shady.</p>

<p>Presently she came to a little house, standing
all alone in the forest, and as she was tired and
thirsty she knocked at the door. She hoped the
good people inside would give her a drink, and let
her rest a little while.</p>

<p>Now, though Goldilocks did not know it, this
house belonged to three bears. There was a
GREAT BIG FATHER BEAR, <span class="smcap">and a middling-sized
mother bear</span>, and a <i>dear little baby bear</i>,
no bigger than Goldilocks herself. But the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
bears had gone out to take a walk in the forest
while their supper was cooling, so when Goldilocks
knocked at the door no one answered her.</p>

<p>She waited awhile and then she knocked again,
and as still nobody answered her she pushed the
door open and stepped inside. There in a row
stood three chairs. One was a GREAT BIG
CHAIR, and it belonged to the father bear. And
one was a <span class="smcap">middling-sized chair</span>, and it belonged
to the mother bear, and one was a <i>dear little chair</i>,
and it belonged to the baby bear. And on the
table stood three bowls of smoking hot porridge.
“And so,” thought Goldilocks, “the people must
be coming back soon to eat it.”</p>

<p>She thought she would sit down and rest until
they came, so first she sat down in the GREAT
BIG CHAIR, but the cushion was too soft. It
seemed as though it would swallow her up. Then
she sat down in the <span class="smcap">middle-sized chair</span>, and
the cushion was too hard, and it was not comfortable.
Then she sat down in the <i>dear little
chair</i>, and it was just right, and fitted her as
though it had been made for her. So there she
sat, and she rocked and she rocked, and she sat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
she sat, until with her rocking and her sitting
she sat the bottom right out of it.</p>

<p>And still nobody had come, and there stood the
bowls of porridge on the table. “They can’t be
very hungry people,” thought Goldilocks to herself,
“or they would come home to eat their suppers.”
And she went over to the table just to see whether
the bowls were full.</p>

<p>The first bowl was a GREAT BIG BOWL with a
GREAT BIG WOODEN SPOON in it, and that
was the father bear’s bowl. The second bowl was
a <span class="smcap">middle-sized bowl</span>, with a <span class="smcap">middle-sized wooden
spoon</span> in it, and that was the mother bear’s bowl.
And the third bowl was a <i>dear little bowl</i>, with a
<i>dear little silver spoon</i> in it, and that was the baby
bear’s bowl.</p>

<p>The porridge that was in the bowls smelled so
very good that Goldilocks thought she would just
taste it.</p>

<p>She took up the GREAT BIG SPOON, and
tasted the porridge in the GREAT BIG BOWL,
but it was too hot. Then she took up the
<span class="smcap">middle-sized spoon</span> and tasted the porridge in the
<span class="smcap">middle-sized bowl</span>, and it was too cold. Then she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
took up the <i>little silver spoon</i> and tasted the
porridge in the <i>dear little bowl</i>, and it was just
right, and it tasted so good that she tasted and
tasted, and tasted and tasted until she tasted it
all up.</p>

<p>After that she felt very sleepy, so she went upstairs
and looked about her, and there were three
beds all in a row. The first bed was the GREAT
BIG BED that belonged to the father bear. And
the second bed was a <span class="smcap">middling-sized bed</span> that
belonged to the mother bear, and the third bed
was a <i>dear little bed</i> that belonged to the dear
little baby bear.</p>

<p>Goldilocks lay down on the GREAT BIG BED to
try it, but the pillow was too high, and she wasn’t
comfortable at all.</p>

<p>Then she lay down on the <span class="smcap">middle-sized bed</span>,
and the pillow was too low, and that wasn’t comfortable
either.</p>

<p>Then she lay down on the <i>little baby bear’s bed</i>
and it was exactly right, and so very comfortable
that she lay there and lay there until she went
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Now while Goldilocks was still asleep in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
little bed the three bears came home again, and as
soon as they stepped inside the door and looked
about them they knew that somebody had been
there.</p>

<p>“SOMEBODY’S BEEN SITTING IN MY
CHAIR,” growled the father bear in his great
big voice, “AND LEFT THE CUSHION
CROOKED.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And somebody’s been sitting in my chair</span>,” said
the mother bear, “<span class="smcap">and left it standing crooked</span>.”</p>

<p>“<i>And somebody’s been sitting in my chair</i>,”
squeaked the baby bear, in his shrill little voice,
“<i>and they’ve sat and sat till they’ve sat the bottom
out</i>”; and he felt very sad about it.</p>

<p>Then the three bears went over to the table
to get their porridge.</p>

<p>“WHAT’S THIS!” growled the father bear,
in his great big voice, “SOMEBODY’S BEEN
TASTING MY PORRIDGE, AND LEFT THE
SPOON ON THE TABLE.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">And somebody’s been taking my porridge</span>,” said
the mother bear in her middle-sized voice, “<span class="smcap">and
they’ve splashed it over the side</span>.”</p>

<p>“<i>And somebody’s been tasting my porridge</i>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
squealed the baby bear, “<i>and they’ve tasted and
tasted until they’ve tasted it all up</i>.” And when
he said so the baby bear looked as if he were about
to cry.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">If somebody’s been here they must be here
still</span>,” said the mother bear; so the three bears
went upstairs to look.</p>

<p>First the father bear looked at his bed. “SOMEBODY’S
BEEN LYING ON MY BED AND
PULLED THE COVERS DOWN,” he growled
in his great big voice.</p>

<p>Then the mother bear looked at her bed.
“<span class="smcap">Somebody’s been lying on my bed and pulled
the pillow off</span>,” said she in her middle-sized
voice.</p>

<p>Then the baby bear looked at his bed, and there
lay little Goldilocks with her cheeks as pink as
roses, and her golden hair all spread over the
pillow.</p>

<p>“<i>Somebody’s been lying in my bed</i>,” squeaked
the baby bear joyfully, “<i>and here she is still!</i>”</p>

<p>Now when Goldilocks in her dreams heard the
great big father bear’s voice she dreamed it was
the thunder rolling through the heavens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>And when she heard the mother bear’s middle-sized
voice she dreamed it was the wind blowing
through the trees.</p>

<p>But when she heard the baby bear’s voice it was
so shrill and sharp that it woke her right up. She
sat up in bed and there were the three bears
standing around and looking at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness me!” cried Goldilocks. She
tumbled out of bed and ran to the window. It was
open, and out she jumped before the bears could
stop her. Then home she ran as fast as she could,
and she never went near the forest again. But
the little baby bear cried and cried because he had
wanted the pretty little girl to play with.</p>

<h2>THE THREE LITTLE PIGS</h2>


<p>A mother pig and her three little pigs lived
together in a wood very happily all through the
long summertime, but towards autumn the mother
pig called her little ones to her and said, “My
dear little pigs, the time has come for you to go out
into the world and seek your own fortunes. You
will each want to build a little house to live in, but
do not build them of straw or leaves; straws are
brittle and leaves are frail. Build your houses
of bricks, for then you will always have a safe
place to live in; you can go in and lock the door,
and nothing can harm you.” She then bade the
little pigs farewell, and away they ran out into the
world to make their fortunes.</p>

<p>The first little pig had not gone far when he
met a man with a load of straw. The straw looked
so warm, and smelled so good that the little pig
quite forgot what his mother had told him.</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Man,” said the little pig, “give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
me enough straw to build a house to keep me warm
through the long winter.”</p>

<p>The man did not say no. He gave the little
pig all the straw he wanted, and then he drove
on.</p>

<p>The little pig built himself a house of straw, and
it was so warm and cosy that he was quite delighted
with it. “How much better,” said he
“than a house of cold hard bricks.”</p>

<p>So he lay there snug and warm, and presently
the old wolf knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Piggy-wig, piggy-wig, let me in!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I won’t, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,”
answered the pig.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your
house in.”</p>

<p>The little pig laughed aloud, for he felt very safe
in his snug straw house.</p>

<p>“Well, then huff, and then puff, and then blow
my house in!” he cried.</p>

<p>Well, the old wolf <i>did</i> huff and puff, and he <i>did</i>
blow the house in, for it was only made of straw,
and then he ate up the pig.</p>

<p>The second little pig when he left the forest ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
along and ran along and presently he met a man
with a great load of leaves.</p>

<p>“Oh, kind Mr. Man, please give me some leaves
to build me a little house for the winter time,”
cried the piggy.</p>

<p>The man was willing to do this. He gave the
pig all the leaves he wanted, and then he went on
his way.</p>

<p>The pig built himself a house of leaves and it
was even snugger and warmer than the straw house
had been. “How silly my mother was,” said the
pig, “to tell me to build a brick house. What
could be warmer and cosier and safer than this.”
And he snuggled down among the leaves and was
very happy.</p>

<p>Presently along came the great wolf, and he
stopped and knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Piggy-wig, piggy-wig, let me in!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I won’t, by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your
house in.”</p>

<p>The little pig laughed when he heard that, for the
walls were thick, and he felt secure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, then huff, and then puff, and then <i>blow</i>
my house in.”</p>

<p>So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he <i>did</i>
blow the house in, and he ate up the little pig that
was inside of it.</p>

<p>Now the third little pig was the smallest pig of
all, but he was a very wise little pig, and he meant
to do exactly as his mother had told him to do.
After he left the forest he met a man driving a
wagon-load of straw, but he did not ask for any
of it. He met the man with the load of leaves,
but he did not ask for any of it. He met a man
with a load of bricks, and <i>then</i> he stopped and
begged so prettily for enough bricks to build himself
a little house that the man could not refuse him.</p>

<p>The pig took the bricks and built himself a little
red house with them, and it was not an easy task
either. When it was done it was not so soft as the
little straw house, and it was not so warm as the
little leaf house, but it was a very <i>safe</i> little house.</p>

<p>Presently the old wolf came along and knocked
at the door—rat-tat-tat!</p>

<p>“Piggy-wig, piggy-wig, let me in,” he called.</p>

<p>“I won’t, by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your
house in.”</p>

<p>“Well, then huff, and then puff, and then blow
my house in,” answered the pig.</p>

<p>So the old wolf huffed and he puffed, and he
<i>puffed and he huffed</i>, and he <span class="smcap">HUFFED AND HE PUFFED</span>
till he almost split his sides, and he just <i>couldn’t</i>
blow the house in, and the little pig laughed to
himself as he sat safe and comfortable inside there.</p>

<p>The old wolf saw there was nothing to be
done by blowing, so he sat down and thought and
thought. Then he said, “Piggy-wig, I know where
there is a field of fine turnips.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked the little pig.</p>

<p>“Open the door and I will tell you.”</p>

<p>No, the little pig could hear quite well with the
door closed.</p>

<p>“It is just up the road three fields away,” said
the wolf, “and if you would like to have some I
will come for you at six o’clock to-morrow morning,
and we will go and dig them up together.”</p>

<p>“At six o’clock!” said the little pig. “Very
well.”</p>

<p>Then the old wolf trotted off home, licking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
lips, and he was well content, for he thought he
would have pig for breakfast the next day.</p>

<p>But the next morning the little pig was up and
astir by five o’clock. Off he trotted to the turnip
field and gathered a whole bagful of turnips and was
home again before the old wolf thought of coming.</p>

<p>At six o’clock the old wolf knocked at the door.</p>

<p>“Are you ready to go for the turnips, Piggy?”
he cried.</p>

<p>“Ready!” answered the pig. “Why I was up
and off to the field an hour ago and I have all the
turnips I want, and I’m boiling them for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you did!” said the wolf. And
then he thought a bit. “Piggy, do you like fine
ripe apples?” he asked.</p>

<p>Yes, the pig was very fond of apples.</p>

<p>“Then I can tell you where to find some.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?”</p>

<p>“Over beyond the hill in the squire’s orchard,
and if you will play me no tricks I will come for
you at five o’clock to-morrow, and we will go
together, and gather some.”</p>

<p>Very well; the pig would be ready.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>So the wolf trotted off home, and this time he
was very sure that he would have a nice fat little
piggy for breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>The little pig got up at four o’clock the next
day, and off he started for the orchard as fast as his
four little feet would carry him. But the way was
long, and the tree was hard to climb, and while he
was still up among the branches gathering apples
the old wolf came trotting into the orchard. The
little pig was very much frightened, but he kept
very still and hoped, up among the leaves, the wolf
would not see him.</p>

<p>The wolf peered about, first up one tree and
then up another, and finally he spied the piggy
up among the branches.</p>

<p>“Why did you not wait for me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew you would be along presently.”</p>

<p>“How soon are you coming down?”</p>

<p>“When I have picked a few more apples.”</p>

<p>The old wolf sat down at the foot of the tree, and
the pig sat up among the branches crunching
apples and smacking his lips.</p>

<p>“Are they good?” asked the wolf looking up;
and his mouth watered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, they were very good.</p>

<p>“Could you not throw one down to me?”</p>

<p>Yes, the little pig could do that.</p>

<p>He picked the biggest, reddest apple he could,
and then he threw it, but he threw it far off, and
in such a way that it went bounding and rolling
down the hill slope. The wolf bounded down
the hill after it, and while he was catching it, the
little pig climbed down the tree and ran safely
home with his basketful of apples.</p>

<p>When the old wolf found the pig had tricked him
again he was very angry. He was more determined
than ever that he would catch the little pig.
He trotted off to the little red house and knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>“Did you get all the apples you wanted?” asked
the wolf.</p>

<p>Yes, the little pig had all he wanted, and he
was very much obliged to the wolf for telling him
about the orchard.</p>

<p>“Listen, Piggy, there’s to be a fine fair over in
the town to-morrow,” said the wolf. “Wouldn’t
you like to go?”</p>

<p>Yes, the little pig would like very much to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well,” said the wolf. “Then I will come
for you at half-past three to-morrow, and we will go
together.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the little pig. But long before
half-past three the next day, piggy was off to the
fair, and he took four bright silver pieces with him,
for he wanted to buy himself a butter-churn. It
did not take him long to buy the churn, and then
he started home again, carrying it on his back.</p>

<p>But the wolf had learned a thing or two about
the little pig’s tricks. He, too, started off to the
fair long before half-past three, and so it was that
the little pig was scarcely half-way home, and had
just reached the top of a high hill, when he saw
the wolf come trotting up the hill directly toward
him. The little pig was terrified. He looked all
around but he could not see any place to hide. He
decided the best thing he could do was to get inside
the churn. So he put it down and crept inside
it. But the hill was very steep, and no sooner was
the piggy inside the churn than it began to roll
down the hill slope bumpety-bumpety-bump, over
rocks and stones, leaping and bounding like a live
thing. The little pig did not know what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
happening to him. He began to squeal at the top
of his voice.</p>

<p>The old wolf was half-way up the hill when he
heard the noise. He looked up, and there was a
great round thing coming bounding over the rocks
straight at him, and squeaking and squeaking as it
came. He gave one look and his hair bristled with
fear, and with a howl he turned tail and ran home
as fast as he could. He never stopped till he was
safe inside his house, and had shut and locked the
door behind him. There he crouched, trembling
and wondering what would happen. But nothing
happened, and all was quiet, so after awhile
the wolf ventured out and ran over to the pig’s
house.</p>

<p>“Piggy, Piggy! Are you in there?”</p>

<p>Yes, the little pig was sitting by the fire roasting
apples.</p>

<p>“Then, listen while I tell you what happened
to me on the way to the fair.” Then the wolf put
his nose close to the crack of the door, and told
the little pig all about the great round squealing
thing that had chased him down the hill.</p>

<p>The little pig laughed and laughed. “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
I can tell you exactly what the great squealing
thing was; it was a churn I had bought at the fair,
and I was inside it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i_b_227.jpg" width="375" height="288" alt="wolf in pot" />
</div>

<p>When the old wolf heard this he was so furious
that he determined to have the little pig whether
or no, even if he had to climb up on the roof and
down the chimney to get him. He stuck his sharp
nails in between the bricks of the house and
climbed right up the side of it and onto the roof.
Then he climbed up on the chimney and slid down
it into the fire-place.</p>

<p>But the little pig had heard what he was doing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and was ready for him. He had a great pot of
boiling water on the fire, and when he heard the
wolf slipping and scrabbling down the chimney he
took the lid off the kettle, and plump! the old wolf
fell right into the boiling water. Then the little
pig clapped the lid tight down over him, and that
was the end of the wolf.</p>

<p>But the little pig lived on in peace and plenty forever
after, and if any other wolf ever came along to
bother him I never heard of it.</p>

<h2>THE GOLDEN KEY</h2>


<p>It was winter, and a little lad had gone out into
the forest to gather wood to keep the fire going at
home. As there was snow upon the ground he
took his little sledge with him, for he could carry
home a larger load on the sledge than on his back.</p>

<p>He gathered together a heap of fallen branches,
and then piled them neatly on the sledge, putting
the larger pieces at the bottom. Before he had
finished the task his fingers were almost frozen,
for he had no mittens. “Before I start to drag my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sled home,” said he to himself, “I will build a fire
and warm my hands a bit.”</p>

<p>He took a stick, and cleared away some of the
snow, so as to have a place to build the fire. When
he had done this he saw a little golden key lying
there on the ground. The little lad picked it up,
wondering. “Wherever there is a key, there
must be a lock,” he said.</p>

<p>He began to scrape away the earth, and presently
he found a curious looking chest made of iron inlaid
with silver. There were words written on the lid of
the chest, but the little boy could not read them.</p>

<p>He lifted the chest out from the earth, and it
seemed to him that something was stirring inside
of it. Then a little thin voice, as thin as a thread,
cried to him. “Let me out! Let me out, and I
will make your fortune.”</p>

<p>The little boy was very much surprised. The
chest seemed too small for any living being to be
in it.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Open the chest and see. If you will only let
me out you will never be sorry.”</p>

<p>The little boy put the golden key in the lock and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
it fitted exactly. He turned it round and the lock
flew back. But as to what was in the chest you
will have to wait until he lifts the lid before you
can see.</p>

<h2>MOTHER HULDA</h2>


<p>There was once a widow who had two daughters;
the elder of the girls was cross and ugly, but the
mother loved her dearly because she was exactly
like herself, and also because she was her own
daughter. The younger girl was only her stepdaughter,
and because of this, and also because the
girl was good and pretty the mother hated her, and
did all she could to make her miserable.</p>

<p>One day the good daughter sat by the well
spinning, and as she spun she wept because she
was so unhappy. The tears blinded her eyes,
and presently she pricked her finger, and a drop
of blood fell on the flax. The girl was frightened,
for she feared her stepmother would scold her
when she saw the flax, so she stooped over the
edge of the well to try to wash the blood off it.
But the spindle slipped from her hand and sank
down and down through the water until it was lost
to sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/i_b_232fp.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="girl at door" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>That was worse than ever; the girl did not know
what her stepmother would do to her when she
heard the spindle had been lost down the well.
Still she was obliged to confess.</p>

<p>The widow was indeed very angry.</p>

<p>“You good-for-nothing!” she cried. “You are
the trouble of my life. Out of my sight, and do
not dare to return until you can bring the spindle
with you,” and she gave the girl a push so that she
almost fell over.</p>

<p>The girl was so frightened and unhappy that she
ran out of the door; without stopping to think, she
jumped into the well. Down, down she sank,
through the waters, just as the spindle had done,
and when she reached the bottom she found herself
in a broad green meadow with a road leading
across it.</p>

<p>The girl followed the road, and presently she
came to a baker’s oven that stood beside the way,
and it was full of bread. The girl was about to
pass by, but the loaves inside called to her, “Take
us out! Take us out! If we are left in the oven
any longer we will burn.”</p>

<p>She was surprised to hear the bread speak to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
her, but she opened the door and drew the loaves
out, and set them neatly on end to cool. Then
she went on.</p>

<p>A little farther, she came to an apple-tree. It
was so loaded down with fruit that the branches
bent with the weight of it.</p>

<p>“Shake me! Shake me!” cried the apple-tree.
“My apples are ripe and my boughs are like to
break with the weight of them.”</p>

<p>The girl shook the apple-tree till the apples fell
about her in a shower. She piled the apples
neatly about the tree and went on her way.</p>

<p>After awhile she came to a little house, and an
ugly old woman with long yellow teeth was looking
out of the window. The girl was frightened at the
old woman’s looks, and was about to turn away,
but the woman called to her, “Do not be afraid. I
will not hurt you. I need a serving-maid. Come
in, and if you serve me faithfully I will reward you
well.”</p>

<p>The girl did not feel afraid any longer. She
opened the door and went in.</p>

<p>The old woman took her upstairs and showed
her a great feather bed. “I am Mother Hulda,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
said she. “It is I who send out the frost and snow
over the world. Every day you must give my bed
a good beating. Then, when the feathers fly, it
snows upon the earth.”</p>

<p>The girl stayed with Mother Hulda many
months. Every day she gave the bed such a good
beating that the feathers flew, and there was much
snow that year. Mother Hulda was very much
pleased with her. She was kind to her, and the
girl had all she wanted to eat, and that of the best,
and a comfortable bed to sleep in; but all the same,
by the time the winter was over she began to feel
sad and dull. She longed to see her home and her
mother and sister, too, even though they were
unkind to her.</p>

<p>“Now I see it is time for you to go back to the
earth again,” said Mother Hulda. “You have
served me well and faithfully, and you shall be
rewarded as I promised you.”</p>

<p>She then opened a closet door and brought out the
girl’s spindle and gave it to her. After that she took
the girl by the hand and led her out of the house
and along a road to a great gate that stood open.</p>

<p>“There lies your way,” said Mother Hulda.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl passed out through the gate, and as
she did so a shower of gold fell all about her like
rain, and stuck to her so that she glittered from
head to foot with gold; even her shoes and her
clothes were golden.</p>

<p>“That is my reward to you because you have
been a good servant,” cried Mother Hulda. Then
the gate closed, and the girl ran along the road and
quickly came to the house of her stepmother.</p>

<p>As she entered the gate the cock crowed loudly,
“Cock-a-doodle-doo! Our golden girl’s come
home again.”</p>

<p>She entered the house, and now her mother
and sister were glad to see her because she was
covered with gold. They asked her where she had
been and who had given her all that treasure.</p>

<p>The girl told them. Then they were filled with
envy.</p>

<p>“Here! Take your spindle,” cried the widow
to her own daughter. “Throw it in the well and
jump down after it. If Mother Hulda has rewarded
your sister in this way what will she not do for
you? No doubt you will come home all covered
with diamonds and rubies.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The ugly girl took her spindle and threw it
down the well, as her mother bade her, and
jumped in after it. Down, down she went, just
as her sister had done, and there was the green
meadow with the road leading across it.</p>

<p>The girl hurried along the road, for she was in
haste to reach Mother Hulda’s house and get a
reward, and presently she came to the oven.</p>

<p>“Take us out! Take us out!” cried the loaves
inside. “We will burn if we are left in here any
longer.”</p>

<p>“Why should I blacken my hands for you?”
cried the girl. “Stay where you are, and if you
burn no one will be the worse for it but yourselves.”
And so saying she went on her way.</p>

<p>A little farther she came to the apple-tree, and
its boughs were bent with the weight of the fruit
it bore.</p>

<p>“Shake me! Shake me!” cried the apple-tree.
“My fruit is ripe, and my boughs are like to break
with the weight of it.”</p>

<p>“Not I!” cried the girl. “I will not shake
you. Suppose one of the apples should fall upon
my head. Your boughs may break for all of me!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
And so she went on her way, munching an apple
that she had picked up from off the ground.</p>

<p>It was not long before she came to Mother
Hulda’s house, and there was Mother Hulda
herself looking out of the window. The ugly
girl was not afraid of her and her long teeth, for
the good sister had already told her about them.
She marched up to the door and opened it as bold
as bold.</p>

<p>“I have come to take service with you,” she
said, “and to get the reward.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered Mother Hulda. “If you
serve me well and faithfully the reward shall not
be lacking.”</p>

<p>She then took the ugly girl upstairs and showed
her the bed, and told her how she was to shake
and beat it. Then she left her there.</p>

<p>The ugly girl began to beat the bed, but she
soon tired of it and came downstairs and asked if
supper were ready. Mother Hulda frowned, but
she said nothing, and she gave the girl a good supper
of bread and meat.</p>

<p>The next day the ugly girl hardly beat the bed
at all, and the next day it was still worse. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
end of the week hardly a flake of snow had floated
out over the world.</p>

<p>“You will never do for me,” said Mother Hulda.
“You will have to go.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” answered the girl. “I am willing,
but give me my reward first.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you shall have your reward,” said Mother
Hulda, “and you deserve it.”</p>

<p>She opened the closet and took out the spindle
and gave it to her, and led her along the road to
the open gate. The girl was very much pleased.
“Now in a moment,” thought she, “I will be all
covered with gold the way my sister was, unless
I am covered with diamonds and rubies.”</p>

<p>“There lies your way,” cried Mother Hulda.</p>

<p>The girl ran through the gate, but instead of gold
or precious stones, a shower of soot fell over her so
that she was black from head to foot.</p>

<p>“That is the reward of your services,” cried
Mother Hulda to the girl, and then she banged the
gate and locked it so that the girl could not come
back.</p>

<p>So the lazy daughter ran home, crying, and as
she entered the gate the cock crowed loudly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
“Cock-a-doodle-doo! Our sooty girl’s come home
again.”</p>

<p>And try as she might the ugly girl could never
get the soot entirely off her. But as to the good
sister she was married to a great nobleman, and
lived happy ever after.</p>

<h2>THE SIX COMPANIONS</h2>


<p>A certain man named John had been a faithful
soldier, and had served the King all through the war,
and had been wounded, too; but when the war
came to an end and he was discharged he only
received three pieces of silver as payment.</p>

<p>“That is a mean way to treat a fellow,” said
John. “But never mind! If I can only get the
right sort of friends to help me we will get all the
King’s treasure from him before we are done.”</p>

<p>So he shouldered his knapsack and off he set
into the world to find the right sort of friends to
help him do this.</p>

<p>He walked along and walked along till he came
to a wood, and there was a man pulling up trees by
the roots as though they were no more than grasses.</p>

<p>“You are the very man for me,” said John.
“Come along with me and we will make our
fortunes.”</p>

<p>The man was willing. “But wait,” said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
“until I tie these fagots together and take them
home to my mother.”</p>

<p>He laid six of the trees together and twisted the
seventh around them to hold them. Then he
walked off with them on his shoulder as easily as
though they were nothing.</p>

<p>When he came back he and the soldier started
out in search of their fortunes.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they came to a
hunter who had raised his gun to his shoulder and
was taking careful aim. The soldier looked about
over the meadows, but could see nothing to shoot.</p>

<p>“What are you aiming at?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Two miles away there is a forest,” said the
man. “In the forest is an oak tree. On the top-most
leaf of that oak tree there is a fly. I am
going to shoot out the left eye of that fly.”</p>

<p>“Come along with me,” said the soldier, “we
three will certainly make our fortunes together.”</p>

<p>Very well; the hunter was willing. So he
shouldered the gun and off he tramped alongside
of the other.</p>

<p>Presently they came to seven mill-wheels, and
the sails were turning merrily, and yet there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
not a breath of wind stirring. “That is a curious
thing!” said the soldier. “Now what is turning
those sails I should like to know.”</p>

<p>Two miles farther on they came to a man sitting
on top of a hill. He held a finger on one side of
his nose and blew through the other.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked the soldier.</p>

<p>“I am blowing to turn the wheels of seven windmills
two miles away, so that the miller can grind
his corn,” answered the man.</p>

<p>“Come with us,” said the soldier. “We are
going out into the world to make our fortunes.”</p>

<p>Very well, the man was willing; the wind was
springing up, anyway, so the miller would not need
him. So now there were four of them journeying
along together.</p>

<p>After awhile they came to a heap of rocks, and
there in the shade of it sat a man. He had unfastened
one of his legs, and taken it off, and he
sat with the other stretched out before him.</p>

<p>“That is a good way to rest,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>“I am not doing this to rest,” said the man.
“I am a runner. If I were to put on this other leg
and start off I would be out of sight in a twinkling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
I have arranged to take off one leg so that I can go
more slowly; though ordinary people find it hard
to keep up with me even so.”</p>

<p>“Take up your leg and come with us,” said the
soldier. “We are going to make our fortunes, and
it shall be share and share alike with us if you
will come along.”</p>

<p>To this the runner agreed. He took up his one
leg and hopped along on the other, and they found
it hard work to keep up with him, he went so fast.</p>

<p>They had gone but a mile or so when they met a
man who wore a little hat cocked down over one
ear.</p>

<p>“Hello!” called the soldier. “Why do you
wear your hat in that fashion instead of straight
on your head like other people?”</p>

<p>“Oh, every time I set it straight there comes such
a heavy frost that the flowers are blighted, and
even the birds freeze in the trees.”</p>

<p>“That is a wonderful gift,” said the soldier.
“Come along with us, and we will make our fortunes
together. And now there are six of us, and
that is enough. We will have no more in our
company.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>So the six stout comrades journeyed on until
they came to the town where the King lived. This
King had one daughter, and she could run so fast
that it was like a bird skimming along, and the King
had said that no one should marry her unless he
could run faster than she could; if such a one came
along he should have her for a wife. But so far no
one had been able to outrun her.</p>

<p>The soldier with his five comrades marched up
to the palace and knocked at the door as bold as
bold, and asked to see the King.</p>

<p>At first the gatekeeper did not wish to let the six
in, for they were worn and dusty, but the soldier
looked at him so fiercely that he did not dare to
refuse.</p>

<p>The six comrades were brought into the great
hall where the King sat with his daughter beside
him and all his nobles about him.</p>

<p>Well, and what did the soldier and his fellows
want with the King.</p>

<p>Oh, the soldier wanted to try a race with the
princess; but he was not much of a runner himself,
so he would let his servant run for him.</p>

<p>The King was willing for that, but he warned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
soldier that if he failed in the race he and his servant,
too, would lose their lives.</p>

<p>The soldier was not afraid to risk that, so the
race course was laid out, and the Princess and the
runner made ready. They were to run to a fountain
miles and miles and miles away, and each was
to fill a pitcher with water and bring it back to the
palace. Whichever first returned with the water
would win the race.</p>

<p>The runner stooped down and buckled on his
second leg, and then he was ready, and he and the
Princess set out. The Princess flew like a bird,
but the runner ran like the wind. He was out of
sight in a twinkling, and had filled his pitcher and
started home again before the Princess was half-way
to the fountain.</p>

<p>The runner sat down to rest a bit. He was very
sleepy and he thought he would just take a little
nap before going the rest of the way. In order not
to be too comfortable and sleep too long he picked
up a horse’s skull that lay in a field near by and put
it under his head for a pillow.</p>

<p>But the runner slept more soundly than he meant
to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess also reached the fountain and filled
her pitcher and started home again, and then, half-way
home, she came across the runner fast asleep
with his pitcher of water beside him.</p>

<p>This was the chance for the Princess. Very
quietly she poured the water from the runner’s
pitcher, and set it down beside him empty. Then
she hurried on toward the palace, leaving the
runner still asleep.</p>

<p>And now all would have been lost except for the
hunter. He had been watching from the palace
window and had seen everything that happened.
He made haste to load his gun, and took aim and
shot the skull from under the sleeper’s head. This
awakened the runner. He sat up and looked about
him.</p>

<p>There was the Princess almost back at the palace,
and his pitcher lay empty beside him.</p>

<p>However, this was nothing to him. He picked up
his pitcher and away he went, swifter than the wind.
He ran back to the fountain and filled the pitcher,
and got back with it to the castle door before the
Princess had come in at the outer gate.</p>

<p>And now by rights the Princess belonged to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
soldier, but the King could not make up his mind to
have her married to a common man like that. As
for the Princess she was ready to cry her eyes out
at the thought of it. She and the King talked and
talked together, and at last they made up a plan
between them.</p>

<p>The King had a room made that was all of iron
and could be heated until it was hotter than any
oven. Then he called the comrades to him and
said, “Now you have fairly won the race, and I
have ordered food and drink to be set out for you,
so that you may make merry over it.”</p>

<p>He then showed the companions into the iron
room, and there a grand feast had been made ready.
The six sat down at table and began to eat and
drink, but the king went on out and locked the
doors behind him. Then he ordered a fire to be
built under the room, and to be kept up until the
room was red hot.</p>

<p>The six companions sat around the table eating
and drinking merrily enough, until they began to
feel too warm. Then they got up to leave the room,
but they found the door was locked and they were
fastened in. At once they guessed the trick that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
had been played upon them, but they were not
troubled over that in the least.</p>

<p>“This is something for you to see to,” said the
soldier to the man with the hat over one ear.</p>

<p>The man set his hat straight and at once a frost
fell upon the room. It grew so cold that the comrades
had to turn up their coat collars and walk
about to keep warm.</p>

<p>The King waited until he thought the six would
certainly be suffocated by the heat, and then he
ordered the door to be opened. What was his
surprise when all the men walked out just as well
and hearty as ever, except that they looked somewhat
pinched with the cold.</p>

<p>But the King was as unwilling as ever to give his
daughter to the soldier. He called the soldier to
him and said, “Listen, if you will give up marrying
the Princess I will make you rich for life.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how much will you give me?” asked
the soldier.</p>

<p>“I will give you all the gold you can carry.”</p>

<p>Well, the soldier hardly knew what to say to
that. Ever since he had been in the war his back
had been weak; but if the King would give him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
much as his servant could carry he would give up
the Princess and welcome.</p>

<p>The King did not care who carried off the gold.
He was quite willing to give as much as the servant
could carry.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the soldier. “In a week’s
time I will come back for the gold, and do you
gather it together and have it ready for me.”</p>

<p>The next thing the soldier did was to hire all the
tailors he could get, and have them make for him
an enormous sack, and when it was finished it was
as big as a house.</p>

<p>When it was done he and the strong man went
back to the palace together, and the week was just
up. The strong man carried the sack, rolled up, on
his shoulders.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King had had a ton of gold
brought up from his treasure-house, and that, he
was sure, was more than the strongest man could
carry.</p>

<p>When the soldier and his comrade came where
the gold was the strong man opened up the sack,
and taking up the ton of gold with one hand he
threw it into the sack. “That will do for a beginning,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
said he, “but we will have to have more
than that.”</p>

<p>The King was frightened. He ordered more gold
and more to be brought up from his treasure-house,
and still there did not begin to be enough. “I can
easily carry twice as much, and more,” cried the
strong man.</p>

<p>At last the King’s treasure-house was empty, and
he sent out all over the kingdom for more gold, and
still there was not enough.</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” cried the strong man at last, “I see
you have done your best; we will have to be content
with what we have.” Then he swung the sack
up over his shoulder and marched off with it, and
the soldier and the other comrades went along with
him.</p>

<p>But the King was in a terrible state of mind.
Here all his treasure had been carried off by a
common soldier and his followers. He would almost
rather have given up the Princess than that.
He stamped and raged, and then he called his horsemen
together, and sent out two regiments after the
comrades to bring them back again and the treasure
with them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not take the horsemen long to catch up to
the comrades for they were traveling along quietly
enough, and without any haste.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” cried the captain of the regiment.
“I have come to take you and the treasure back to
the King. Will you come along quietly, or will we
have to drag you?”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” said the blower. “Before we
talk further about it suppose you take a dance in
the air.” He put one finger to his nostril and blew
through the other and away went the captain and
his regiment, whirling and dancing through the air
like dry leaves when the wind blows them.</p>

<p>After awhile he allowed them to settle down to
earth again. “There!” said he. “Have you had
enough, or would you like another dance?”</p>

<p>No! the regiment had no wish for another whirl
through the air. All they wished for now was to get
safely back to the palace again.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the blower. “Then go back
to the King and tell him if he sends his whole army
out after us I will treat it in the same way.”</p>

<p>But this the King dared not do. His treasure
was gone and he could not risk having his army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
blown away, into the bargain. The comrades went
on their way with no further hindrance, and after
awhile they sat down and divided the treasure
among them and each one had enough to make him
rich and prosperous for life.</p>

<h2 class='faux'>THE GOLDEN BIRD</h2>


<p>There was once a King who had in his gardens
an apple-tree that bore golden apples. Every day
the King went out to count the apples, and no one
was allowed to touch them but himself.</p>

<p>One morning, when the King went out to count
them as usual he found that one of them was gone.
He was very much vexed, and ordered that at
night a guard should be set around the garden,
that no one might steal the apples, but the very
next morning still another one was missing. So
it happened day after day. Every gate to the
garden was carefully guarded, and yet every
morning another apple was gone from the tree, and
they could not tell who had taken it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the King had three sons, and one day the
eldest came to his father and said, “Father, to-night
I will watch under the apple-tree, and you
may be sure that no one will be able to come near
it without my seeing him.”</p>

<p>The King was quite willing for his son to keep
watch, so that night the Prince took his place under
the tree.</p>

<p>For some hours he sat there and watched, and
scarcely winked an eyelid; but in the middle of the
night a light shone around him and he heard a
sound of music. Then, in spite of himself, he fell
into a deep sleep, and when he awoke in the
morning another apple had been stolen.</p>

<p>That day the second son came to the King and
asked that he might be allowed to watch the apple-tree
that night.</p>

<p>Again the King consented, and as soon as night
came the second son went out and sat under the
apple-tree just as his brother had done. Then
just the same thing happened as had happened
before. Toward midnight a light shone around
the tree, and there was a sound of music, and then,
do what he would, he could not stay awake. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
slept, and while he slept another apple was
taken.</p>

<p>The third day it was the turn of the third son to
ask to be allowed to watch under the apple-tree.
But the King refused. “Do you think that you are
cleverer than your brothers?” he asked. “Why
should you succeed when they have failed?” But
the Prince begged and entreated until at last the
King gave him permission to watch under the tree.</p>

<p>Now the third Prince was a wise youth; he had
heard what happened to his brothers on the other
two nights, so when evening came he stuffed his
ears with cotton, and then he went out and took his
place under the apple-tree. There he sat, and
just before midnight a light shone through the
branches, and there was a sound of music. But
the young Prince had stuffed his ears with cotton
so he could not hear the music, and he did not go
to sleep.</p>

<p>After the music came a sound of wings, though
this, too, the Prince could not hear, and a golden bird
alighted on the apple-tree. The bird was about
to pick one of the apples when the Prince raised his
crossbow and shot a bolt at it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>The bird escaped, but one of its golden feathers
fluttered down and fell at the Prince’s feet. He
picked it up, and the next morning he took it to his
father and told him what he had seen in the night.</p>

<p>As soon as the King saw the feather he was filled
with the greatest desire to have the bird. “Life
is worth nothing to me without that bird,” said he.
“I would give my kingdom to possess it.”</p>

<p>When the eldest brother heard that, he at once
made up his mind to set out in search of the bird,
for he thought it would be a fine thing to gain the
kingdom for himself. He went by himself, taking
no one with him, for he did not wish anyone else
to have a hand in the search.</p>

<p>He journeyed on for some distance and then he
came to a cross-road, and there at the cross-roads
he saw a little red fox sitting. The Prince drew
his bow to shoot, but the animal called to him,
“Do not shoot me, Prince, and I will give you a
piece of good advice that is worth more than my
skin.”</p>

<p>“What can a beast tell me that is worth hearing?”
asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said the fox. “I know where you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
are going, that it is in search of the Golden Bird,
but unless you do as I say you will never find it.
To-night you will reach a village. In this village
there are two inns that stand opposite to each
other. One is a fine place. It will be lighted up,
and there will be music and dancing inside. But
do not enter there. The other inn is poor and
miserable looking, but that is where you must stay
if you hope to find the Golden Bird.”</p>

<p>“That is foolish talk, and I would be even more
foolish to heed it,” cried the Prince, and again
drawing his bow he shot a bolt at the fox. The
bolt missed the mark, and the fox ran away unharmed.</p>

<p>The King’s son rode on, and at nightfall he
entered a village. There on each side of the
street stood an inn, and they were just such inns
as the fox had told him of. One was a fine place,
well-lighted, and with dancing and music going on
inside. The other was dark and poor and miserable-looking.</p>

<p>The Prince never gave another thought to the
fox’s advice. He turned in to the fine inn, and
there he ate and drank and laughed with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
who were there before him, and forgot all about
the Golden Bird, and his father and the kingdom,
too.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and still the eldest son did not
return home, and no one knew what had become of
him. Then the second son wished to try his luck
at finding the Golden Bird. The King did not wish
him to go, but the Prince was so eager that at last
the father gave his consent.</p>

<p>The Prince journeyed on until he came to the
cross-roads, and there sat the fox, just as it had before.
The second son was about to shoot it, but
the little animal called to him to spare its life and
it would give him a piece of good advice.</p>

<p>The Prince was curious to hear what the fox had
to say, but after he had heard of the two inns, and
that it was the poor mean-looking one he must
choose, he laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“A pretty piece of advice,” he cried, “and I
would be a great simpleton to follow it.” Then he
shot a bolt at the fox, but he missed his aim, and
the little animal ran away unharmed.</p>

<p>Then it happened with the second Prince just as
it had with his elder brother. He came to the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
inns just at nightfall, and it was at the fine well-lighted
inn that he stopped. There he spent the
night in feasting and merry-making, and by the
next day he had forgotten all about the Golden
Bird, and his father, and the kingdom he had hoped
to gain.</p>

<p>Now when time passed and the second son did
not return either, it was the third Prince who
wished to set out upon the search. But, “No,
no,” said his father, “that I cannot allow. I have
lost two sons already, and am I to lose my third son
also?”</p>

<p>But the Prince had set his heart on going.</p>

<p>He begged and entreated until the King could no
longer refuse him.</p>

<p>The Prince set out upon his journey, and it was
not long before he reached the cross-roads, and
found the fox sitting there, just as his brothers
had before him. The Prince had his bow slung
at his back, but he did not draw it.</p>

<p>“Do not shoot me, Prince,” cried the fox, “and
I will give you a piece of good advice.”</p>

<p>“Why should I shoot you?” answered the Prince.
“I have no quarrel with you. And as for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
advice, who knows but what it may be well worth
having?”</p>

<p>“Then listen,” said the fox; and he told the
Prince about the two inns, just as he had told the
other brothers.</p>

<p>“That may or may not be good advice,” said the
Prince, “but at least it will do me no harm to follow
it.”</p>

<p>So when he entered the village he did not go to
the fine inn as his brothers had done. Instead he
turned in at the poor, mean-looking inn, and there
he spent the night quietly, and the next day he
arose, and went on his way.</p>

<p>Just outside the village he came across the fox
sitting in a field and waiting for him.</p>

<p>“Prince,” said the fox, “you did well indeed
to follow my advice. Now seat yourself upon my
tail and I will carry you on your journey far faster
than you can walk.”</p>

<p>The Prince did as the fox bade him. He seated
himself upon its tail and then away they went, so
fast that the wind whistled past the Prince’s ears.
Presently they came within sight of a great castle,
and there the fox stopped. “In that castle is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Golden Bird,” said the fox, “but now you must
go on alone. Follow this road, and it will lead
you to the gate of the castle. All around you will
see soldiers lying asleep on the ground, but do not
fear them. They will not awake unless you disobey
what I am about to tell you.”</p>

<p>The fox then told the Prince in which room of the
castle he would find the Golden Bird. “It is in
an ugly, mean-looking cage,” said he, “and close
by hangs a handsome golden cage that is empty.
But do not by any means put the bird in the golden
cage. Bring it away in the mean-looking cage, for
unless you do this some great misfortune will
come upon you.”</p>

<p>The Prince was so happy to think he was soon to
find the Golden Bird that he scarcely listened to
anything else the fox told him.</p>

<p>He sprang from the fox’s tail and hastened
along the road to the castle, and soon he came to
the soldiers lying asleep upon the ground. He
went past them safely and they did not wake. He
entered the castle and it did not take him long to
find the Golden Bird. There it was in the very room
the fox had told him of. It was in a mean, common-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cage, and beside it hung a handsome
golden cage that was empty.</p>

<p>“It is a foolish thing,” thought the Prince, “to
put a golden bird in a cage like that. It would be
much better to put it in the cage that suits it.” So
thinking, he took the bird from the ugly cage and
put it in the handsome one. As soon as he did
this the bird began to shriek. This sound awakened
the soldiers. They ran in and seized the
Prince, and carried him before the King of the
country.</p>

<p>When the King heard how the Prince had tried to
steal the Golden Bird he was very angry. “You
deserve to be put to death,” said he, “but I will
spare your life on one condition. If you will bring
me the Golden Horse that goes swifter than the
wind, you shall be pardoned, and I will give you
the Golden Bird into the bargain.”</p>

<p>Well, there was no help for it; the Prince had to
set out to find the Golden Horse, but he was very
sad, for he did not know where to look for it, and
unless he found it he would have to return and lose
his life.</p>

<p>He went along the road and he had not gone far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
when he saw the fox sitting in a field and waiting
for him.</p>

<p>“Why did you not follow my advice?” said the
fox. “Now you are in a pretty scrape. But
mount upon my tail and I will see what I can do to
help you.”</p>

<p>The Prince seated himself upon the fox’s tail
and away they went, over bush and brake, over
rock and brier, so fast the wind whistled by the
Prince’s ears.</p>

<p>Presently they came within sight of another
castle, and there the fox stopped. “Light down,”
said he, “for I can carry you no farther. In the
stable of that castle is the Golden Horse you are in
search of. Go on boldly and open the stable door.
No one will stop you, for the stableman is asleep.
Only when you find the Golden Horse do not take
the golden saddle that hangs beside the stall. Take
the worn old saddle that lies in the corner. Unless
you do as I tell you misfortune will surely come
upon you.”</p>

<p>The Prince scarcely listened to the fox, he was in
such a hurry to find the Golden Horse. He hurried
up the road to the stable and opened the stable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
door, and no one stopped nor stayed him. There
in the stall stood the Golden Horse, and it shone
so that the light from it filled the whole place.
Hanging beside the stall was a golden saddle set
with precious stones, and in the corner lay an old
worn-out saddle of leather. “This golden saddle is
the saddle that belongs with the Golden Horse,”
thought the Prince. “It would be a shame to put
the other upon its back.”</p>

<p>So he took down the golden saddle and laid it
on the horse. As soon as he did so, the horse
began to neigh and stamp. The sound awoke the
stableman, and he called the guard. The soldiers
came running in haste and seized the Prince
and carried him before the King and told him
the youth had been trying to steal the Golden
Horse.</p>

<p>“You deserve to die for this,” said the King,
“but I will forgive you on one condition. If you
will bring me the Princess of the Golden Castle for
a wife then you shall not only receive my pardon,
but the Golden Horse into the bargain.”</p>

<p>Well, the Prince did not see how he was to find
the Princess of the Golden Castle, but he promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
to do his best. He set out and he had not gone
far when he found the fox waiting for him.</p>

<p>“You do not deserve my help,” said the fox.
“Why did you disobey me and put the golden
saddle upon the horse? But mount upon my tail.
I suppose I must do the best I can to pull you out
of this scrape also.”</p>

<p>The Prince set himself upon the fox’s tail, and
away they went again so fast that the wind whistled
through his hair.</p>

<p>On and on they went, and after a time they
came to another castle, and this castle was all of
shining gold. “Now listen,” said the fox. “In
this castle lives the beautiful Princess we are in
search of. Do you go and hide yourself by the bathhouse
down by the lake. Every night, when all
in the castle are asleep, the Princess comes down
to the lake to bathe. When she comes near the
bathhouse you must seize her and kiss her.
Then she will willingly follow you wherever you
lead. But whatever you do do not allow her to go
back to bid farewell to her parents. If you do
you may answer for it with your life.”</p>

<p>The Prince promised to do as the fox told him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and then he went away and hid himself behind
the bathhouse.</p>

<p>That night, as soon as all in the castle were
asleep, the Princess came down to the lake to bathe
as usual. As soon as she came near the bathhouse
the Prince sprang out from behind it and
caught her in his arms and kissed her. Then
the Princess loved him, and was quite willing to
leave her home and her father and mother and
follow him.</p>

<p>“But before I follow you, let me go and say
good-by to my parents,” she said, “for they love
me dearly, and their hearts will surely break if I
leave them without one word.”</p>

<p>It seemed to the Prince that it would be cruel
to refuse what she asked. Beside, what harm
could it do for her to see her parents once more?</p>

<p>“Very well,” said he. “Go, but return quickly,
for we must be off before the day breaks.”</p>

<p>The Princess hurried away to the room where
the King, her father, lay asleep, and she stooped and
kissed him on the forehead. At once the King
awoke and asked her where she was going.</p>

<p>When he heard she was going out into the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to follow an unknown youth, he sent out and had
the Prince brought into the palace. There the
King said to him, “You have come here to steal the
Princess from me, and for this you deserve to die.
But I will give you one chance for your life. Outside
my windows is a mountain so high and dark
that not a ray of sunlight ever comes into the
castle. If in three days you can level down this
mountain, then I will grant you your life, and give
you my daughter for a bride.”</p>

<p>When the Prince heard this he was in despair,
for he did not see how he could possibly level down
a mountain in three years, let alone three days.
However, he took a pick and shovel and set to
work. For two days he dug and shoveled, and
at the end of that time he had scarcely dug away
enough to fill a ditch.</p>

<p>At the end of that time the fox came to him.
“Now you see how little you can do,” said he.
“You do not deserve that I should help you
again, but I have a soft heart. Do you lie down
and rest awhile, and I will do the work for
you.”</p>

<p>The Prince trusted the fox, and he was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
tired. He flung himself down upon the ground,
and fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke the next morning the mountain
had disappeared. The place where it had stood
was as flat as the palm of the hand.</p>

<p>When the King looked from his windows and
found the mountain gone he was filled with joy
and wonder. “You have indeed fairly won the
Princess,” said he to the Prince, “and I will not
say you nay.”</p>

<p>So he gave his daughter to the stranger youth,
and much treasure as well. He also gave them
each a horse trapped out in gold and precious
stones, and then the two set out together, riding
side by side.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they met the little
red fox, and he was on the watch for them.</p>

<p>“Now you have indeed won the best of all,”
said he. “But it is you and you alone who should
have the Princess for a wife. But in order to keep
her for yourself you must do exactly as I say.
First of all you must go to the King who sent you to
the golden castle. When he sees you have brought
the Princess to him, he will gladly give you the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Golden Horse. Mount upon the horse, and when
you say farewell to the King and his court, take the
hand of each one in turn. Last of all you must
take the hand of the Princess. Grasp it firmly,
and draw her up into the saddle in front of you,
and then ride away for your life. They may
pursue you, but none can overtake you, for the
Golden Horse goes faster than the wind.”</p>

<p>The Prince did exactly as the fox bade him. He
took the Princess to the palace of the King who had
sent him to find her. When the King saw her he
gladly gave the Golden Horse to the Prince. The
Prince said farewell to all and then at the last he
caught the Princess by the hand and drew her up
in front of him, and away they went faster than the
wind, and none pursed them, for they knew they
could never catch them.</p>

<p>After awhile the Prince and Princess came to
the fox seated by the road waiting for them.</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the fox. “You have now
the beautiful Princess and the Golden Horse, but
you must have the Golden Bird also.”</p>

<p>The fox then told the Prince what he must do.
He must leave the Princess there to wait for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and ride on to the palace alone. “When you reach
the palace of the King,” said the fox, “he will gladly
give you the Golden Bird in exchange for the horse.
Take the cage in your hand and then spring upon
the horse and ride away with it till you come to
where the Princess is. They will not try to overtake
you, for they know how fast the horse goes.
Then you will have all three, the Princess, the horse,
and the bird.”</p>

<p>The Prince did exactly as the little animal bade
him. He left the Princess there with the fox, and
rode on to the palace, and it was not long before he
was back again with the Golden Bird in his hand.</p>

<p>“Now you have all your heart desires,” said the
fox, “and it is time I had my reward for serving
you.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the Prince. “Tell me how
to reward you, and if I can do it, I will.”</p>

<p>“Then take your bow,” said the fox, “and shoot
me dead, and after that cut off my head and paws.”</p>

<p>The Prince was filled with horror. “No, no,”
he cried, “that I can never do.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the fox. “If you will not do
that, then you can do nothing for me. I must leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
you, but before I go there is one more piece of
advice that I will give you. Beware of two things.
Buy no human flesh and bones, and do not sit on
the edge of a well.” Then the fox left him and
ran away into the forest near by.</p>

<p>But the Prince and Princess rode on together.
“That was a curious piece of advice,” said the
Prince. “Why should I want to buy human flesh
and bones, and why should I not sit on the edge of
a well if it pleases me?”</p>

<p>“Why indeed?” said the Princess.</p>

<p>The two journeyed on until they came to the
village where the two inns stood, and there the
Prince stopped at the larger inn to water his horse,
and who should come out to fetch water for the
horse but the Prince’s second brother, and he was
all in rags.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear brother,” cried the Prince, “what
has happened to you? Why are you all in rags?”</p>

<p>“It is because I am in debt to the landlord,”
answered the second Prince. “I spent all my own
money and more beside in feasting and drinking,
and now he keeps me as a servant and will not let
me go.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“And our eldest brother—is he here also?”</p>

<p>Yes, he was there also. He too was in debt to
the landlord, and was obliged to work about in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>When the youngest brother heard this the tears
ran down his cheeks. He called the landlord to
him and paid him all that the two brothers owed,
and bought them free. He also bought for each of
them proper clothes and fine horses to ride upon.</p>

<p>Then they all started home together. But the
elder brothers were not grateful to him. They
envied and hated him because he had won the
Princess and the Golden Horse and the bird, and
because he would have their father’s kingdom,
too. So they plotted together as to how they could
get rid of him.</p>

<p>They journeyed on for some hours until it was
midday and the sun was hot. Then they came to
a place where there was a well with trees around it.</p>

<p>“Let us sit here and rest awhile,” said the
elder brothers, and the youngest was willing.</p>

<p>They all lighted down from their horses, and
then the two elder brothers seized the younger one
and threw him into the well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>After that they took the Princess, the horse, and
the bird, and rode on with them.</p>

<p>When at last they reached the palace of their
father there was the greatest rejoicing. Not only
had the princes brought home with them the Golden
Bird, but they had brought the Golden Horse, and
the beautiful Princess as well, and now the kingdom
was to be divided between them. As for the
youngest Prince no one knew what had become of
him except his brothers and the Princess.</p>

<p>But the Princess took no part in any of the rejoicings.
She sat and grieved and grieved. The
horse would not eat and the bird would not sing.
The King was greatly distressed over all this. He
could not guess what ailed them all.</p>

<p>But though the brothers had thrown the youngest
brother into a well, that was not the last of him by
any means. The well was a dry one, and the Prince
fell softly on the moss at the bottom of it, and was
not hurt at all except for a few bruises. But the
sides of the well were so steep that he could not
climb out of it, and there in the well he might have
stayed had it not been for the faithful fox. The
Prince had not been long in the well when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
fox looked down over the edge of it and spoke to
him.</p>

<p>“You little deserve that I should help you again,”
said the fox. “If you had heeded my warnings all
this trouble would not have come upon you. Nevertheless,
I cannot leave you here to perish. Catch
hold of my tail, and I will pull you out.”</p>

<p>The fox then let its tail hang down in the well, the
Prince caught hold of it, and the fox managed to
drag him out of the well and up into the sunlight.</p>

<p>The Prince thanked the fox with tears in his eyes,
and then he journeyed on toward his father’s
palace. On the way he met an old beggar-man,
and exchanged clothes with him. He put on the
beggar’s rags, and stained his hands and face so
that he was as dark as a gypsy, and when he came
at last into the palace not even his father knew
him. No sooner did he enter the gate of the
palace, however, than the bird began to sing, the
horse began to eat, and the Princess wiped away
her tears, and laughed aloud with joy.</p>

<p>The King was amazed. “How is this?” he
asked the Princess. “How is it that you have so
suddenly ceased grieving and become cheerful?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know not,” answered the Princess. “Only
this morning I was so sad that my heart was like
lead, and now suddenly I feel quite happy, just as
though my own dear promised husband had come
home again.”</p>

<p>The Princess then told the King the whole story,
how it was the youngest Prince who had won the
bird and the horse, and her also for his bride; how
he had bought his brothers’ lives from the landlord
at the inn, and how they had afterward thrown
him into a dry well and left him there.</p>

<p>“It may be,” said the King, “that my son has
in truth come home, and is here in the palace, and
that that is why you feel so happy.”</p>

<p>He then gave orders that everyone in the palace
was to come before him. This was done, and
among all the rest came the young Prince disguised
as an old beggar-man.</p>

<p>But though he was disguised the Princess knew
him at once. She ran to him and threw her arms
about his neck and kissed him. “You are my
own dear one,” she cried, “and to you and you
only do I belong.”</p>

<p>Then there was great rejoicing all through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
palace because the Prince had come home again.
But as for the elder brothers they were sent out
from before the King’s presence and punished as
they deserved.</p>

<p>Now some time after this as the young Prince
was hunting in the forest he met the little red fox,
and it looked very sad and thin and worn.</p>

<p>“Alas!” said he to the Prince, “now you are
happy and have everything your heart can wish,
but I am hunted about the world, miserable and
forlorn.”</p>

<p>Then the Prince was filled with pity. “Whatever
I can do for you I will,” he said, “for everything
I have I owe to you.”</p>

<p>Then again the fox begged and implored the
Prince to shoot it and cut off its head and its
paws. At last the Prince consented.</p>

<p>No sooner had he done as the fox asked him,
than instead of the little animal a handsome young
man stood before him. This young man was the
brother of the Princess Beautiful. He had been
enchanted, and obliged to wander about the world
in the shape of a fox, but now the young Prince
had broken the enchantment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>The two princes embraced each other tenderly,
and returned to the palace together, and
after that they all lived together in the greatest
happiness.</p>

<h2>THE NAIL</h2>


<p>A merchant had been trading in a far city and
had made much money, which he was now bringing
home with him. He rode in haste, for he knew he
would not feel easy until he had locked away the
gold in his strong room at home.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the morning he stopped at
an inn to give his horse water. “Sir,” said the
ostler who waited on him, “a nail is loose in your
horse’s shoe.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” answered the merchant. “I am
in haste, and the shoe must go as it is till I get
home.”</p>

<p>A little later he stopped at another inn. “Sir,”
said the ostler, “your horse’s shoe is loose; shall
I not take him to the blacksmith near by and have
the shoe fastened on?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the merchant, “I have not
time to wait. I must be home before nightfall.”</p>

<p>The merchant rode still farther, but presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
his horse began to limp. It limped more and more,
until at last, in the very midst of a deep forest, it
stumbled and fell, and could not get up again.</p>

<p>The merchant was in despair. Dusk was coming
on, and there seemed nothing for it but to spend the
night in the forest. However, he discovered a house
near by, and the old woman who was in charge of it
promised him food and a lodging for the night.</p>

<p>When the merchant went up to bed he put his
bag of gold under his pillow. He meant to watch
all night, but he was very tired, and presently, in
spite of himself his eyes closed and he fell into a
deep sleep.</p>

<p>Now this house belonged to a band of robbers,
and the old woman was their housekeeper. Soon
after the merchant was asleep the robbers came
home. The housekeeper told them of the rich man
who had come to the house while they were away,
and of how she had given him a bed for the night.</p>

<p>The robbers went up to the merchant’s room
and finding him asleep they stole the bag of money
from under his pillow, and made off with it.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the merchant awoke, he
felt under his pillow for the bag, but it was gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
He called aloud, but no one answered. He
searched the house from top to bottom, but could
find nobody.</p>

<p>So the merchant lost both his gold and his horse.
“And all,” said he, “because I was in such haste
that I would not stop for a nail to be put in my
horse’s shoe. It is a true saying—‘the more haste
the less speed.’”</p>

<h2>LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD</h2>


<p>There was once a little girl whose father and
mother loved her so dearly that they thought
nothing too good for her. Her mother made for her
the prettiest of little dresses; her stockings were of
fine yarn, and there were bright buckles on her
shoes. Her mother also made for her a little cloak
and hood of red cloth, and the little girl looked so
pretty in them that her mother called her Little
Red Riding-Hood instead of Mary, as she had been
christened.</p>

<p>Little Red Riding-Hood had a grandmother who
was so old that sometimes she lay in bed all day
and felt too weak to get up.</p>

<p>One day the mother called the little girl to her
and said, “My child, I have put a pat of butter and
some fresh eggs and a wheatcake in this basket.
Take it and carry it to your grandmother. Run
along quickly, and do not loiter nor stop to talk to
anyone along the way, for I want you to get back
before the afternoon is late.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/i_b_284fp.jpg" width="433" height="535" alt="Red Riding Hood and wolf" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, dear mother,” said the little girl, and she
took the basket in her hand and set out for her
grandmother’s house.</p>

<p>At first she ran along briskly and stopped for
nothing, but the fields were full of pretty flowers.
“I am sure,” thought Red Riding-Hood “that my
grandmother would be glad to have a bunch of
daisies and buttercups.” She began to pick one
here and another there until she had quite a
handful.</p>

<p>Presently she heard feet padding along the path,
and the old gray wolf came trotting by.</p>

<p>“Good-day, Red Riding-Hood,” said the wolf.</p>

<p>“Good-day,” answered the child.</p>

<p>“And where are you going this fine bright day
with your basket on your arm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am going to my grandmother’s house.
She is so old that sometimes she lies in bed and
cannot get up, and I am taking her some butter and
some fresh eggs and a wheaten cake.”</p>

<p>“And where does your grandmother live?”</p>

<p>“She lives over beyond the wood in a little white
house with a thatched roof and green blinds, and
the path runs straight there.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The wolf had now learned all he cared to know.
He bade Red Riding-Hood good-by and trotted on
briskly.</p>

<p>As soon as he came into the wood where Red
Riding-Hood could not see him he began to gallop.
On and on he galloped as fast as he could, for he
was anxious to get to the little white house with the
thatched roof and the green blinds before Red
Riding-Hood did.</p>

<p>In the depths of the wood a woodcutter was busy
at his work. He saw the old wolf go hurrying by,
and he wondered what he was after. “He’s up to
some mischief or other, and that is sure,” said the
woodcutter. And he shouldered his axe and followed
on after the wolf to see what he was going to
do.</p>

<p>On went Mr. Wolf, and presently he came to the
edge of the forest, and there stood the little white
house with the thatched roof and green blinds, and
the path led straight up to the door, so the wolf
knew that must be where the grandmother lived.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked all about him, for he did
not want anyone to watch him. He saw no one,
however, for the woodchopper had hidden behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
some rocks. Then the wolf knocked at the door,
rap-tap-tap!</p>

<p>Nobody answered, so he knocked again, rap-tap-tap!
Still no one answered, and there was no stir
within the house, though the wolf cocked his ear
and listened carefully. The wolf pulled the latchstring,
the latch flew up, and he pushed the door
open, and slipped inside. He looked about, and
there was nobody there, for the old grandmother
had been feeling stronger that day, so she had
dressed and had gone out to see a neighbor.</p>

<p>The old wolf hunted about until he found the
grandmother’s bedgown; then he pulled it on over
his big hairy body. He tied on a big ruffled cap
and put the grandmother’s spectacles on his nose,
and after that he crawled into bed and drew the
coverlet up under his chin.</p>

<p>The woodcutter, outside, wondered what the
wolf was doing in the house, but he did not hear a
sound, so he sat down to watch and see what would
happen next, and as he was very tired he fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>It was not long before Little Red Riding-Hood
came running along, and she was in a great hurry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
for she had spent a long time gathering flowers.
The woodcutter did not see her, however, for he
was asleep. The little girl ran up to the door and
knocked upon it, rap-tap-tap!</p>

<p>Then the old wolf made his voice very faint and
weak like the grandmother’s. “Who is there?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“It is I, grandmother; Little Red Riding-Hood,”
answered the child.</p>

<p>“Pull the latchstring, and lift the latch,” said
the wolf.</p>

<p>Red Riding-Hood lifted the latch and pushed the
door open and went in.</p>

<p>There was not much light in the room, for the
wolf had pulled the curtains across the window.</p>

<p>“I am not able to get up, dear child,” said the
wolf, still in the same weak voice. “Put your
basket on the table and come over here.”</p>

<p>Red Riding-Hood did as she was told. She put
the basket on the table and came over to the bedside,
but as she came closer she thought her
grandmother looked very strange.</p>

<p>“Oh, grandmother, what great big eyes you
have,” said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“The better to see you, my dear,” answered the
wolf.</p>

<p>“But, oh grandmother, what long, long ears you
have.”</p>

<p>“The better to hear you, my dear!”</p>

<p>“But, grandmother, what big sharp white teeth
you have!”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The better to eat you!</span>” howled the wolf, and
he sprang out of bed and caught Red Riding-Hood
by the cloak.</p>

<p>The little girl cried out, but at this moment
the woodcutter burst open the door and rushed in.
The howl had awakened him from his sleep, and
just in time. He struck the wolf such a blow on the
head that it fell down dead.</p>

<p>Then he took Red Riding-Hood up in his arms
and comforted her, for she was crying bitterly.
She was frightened and her pretty red cloak had
been torn. He wiped her eyes, and promised to
walk home with her, but first, he said, they must
wait until the grandmother came home.</p>

<p>When she came at last, and heard the story and
saw the wolf lying there on the floor, she could not
thank the woodcutter enough. And indeed, if it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had not been for him the little girl would certainly
have been eaten by the wolf.</p>

<p>But from then on Red Riding-Hood was careful
to obey her mother, and not to loiter on the way
when she was sent on errands.</p>

<h2>ALADDIN, OR THE MAGIC LAMP</h2>


<p>In a far city in China there once lived a lad
named Aladdin. Aladdin’s mother was a widow,
and the boy had never had a father’s care. He did
as he pleased, and played in the streets all day, and
was so idle that he was of no use to anyone.</p>

<p>One day, as Aladdin was playing with a band
of companions, a tall man, richly dressed, stopped
to watch them. Suddenly he called to Aladdin,
“Come here, boy; I wish to speak to you.”</p>

<p>The lad came, wondering.</p>

<p>“Are you not the son of Mustapha the tailor?”
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>Aladdin said that he was.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” cried the stranger. “I knew it
from your likeness to your dear father.” He then
embraced the boy tenderly. “I, dear lad, am
your uncle,” said he. “I have spent many years
in strange countries, and have made a fortune.
I came back here in search of you, for I heard your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
father was dead, and I wish to take his place and
be a father to you.”</p>

<p>Aladdin was very much surprised. He had never
known he had an uncle. And indeed he had not.
The stranger was a magician who had need of a
stout and active lad to help in a certain adventure.
He had noticed Aladdin playing in the streets and
had found out the lad’s name and the name of his
father, so as to pass himself off as Aladdin’s uncle.</p>

<p>Aladdin was eager to believe the story the
stranger told, for he thought it would be a fine thing
to have a rich uncle to help him along in the world.</p>

<p>“Lead me to your mother’s house, Aladdin,”
said the magician. “I wish to talk with her, and
to weep with her over the memory of my dear
brother.”</p>

<p>Aladdin took the stranger’s hand and led him
away through one street after another, each
meaner and dirtier than the other. At last he
stopped before a miserable looking hovel.</p>

<p>“This is where I live,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried the magician. “Oh, what a
miserable place for my brother’s child to live. But
I will soon change all this. You must move into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
handsome house, and you must have some better
clothes than those you have on. I will make your
fortune for you.”</p>

<p>Aladdin was more delighted than ever when he
heard this. He made haste to open the door and
lead the magician to his mother, and to repeat to
her the story he had been told.</p>

<p>The widow was even more surprised than her son
over the magician’s story, but she was quite as
eager to believe it as he. It would indeed be a
fine thing if the stranger would lift them out of their
poverty. She begged him to sit down and share
their evening meal, but this he would not do. He
said he had business with some merchants, and went
away, after promising to come back the next day.</p>

<p>On the morrow, as he had promised, the magician
returned, and he took Aladdin out with him,
and bought him fine clothes, and sweetmeats to
eat, and he talked so much of all he meant to do
for his dear nephew that the boy’s head was quite
turned.</p>

<p>The following morning he came again, and asked
Aladdin whether he would not like to take a walk
in the country, as it was such a fine day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Aladdin gladly agreed to this plan. It was pleasant
to be with his new uncle, and to hear him talk
of all the grand things he intended to do.</p>

<p>The magician led the boy out of the city, talking
pleasantly all the while, and on and on into the
country, so far that at last the lad began to grow
weary and to wonder when they would turn
back.</p>

<p>In time they came to a lonely valley shut in by
high hills, and here the stranger stopped. “My
dear nephew, I wish to show you something here
that is very curious,” said the false uncle. “But
first gather together a few dry sticks and build a
little fire.”</p>

<p>This Aladdin did.</p>

<p>When the fire was burning brightly the magician
drew from under his robe a small box. He opened
it, and taking from it a pinch of powder he threw it
into the fire, at the same time saying some magic
words.</p>

<p>Immediately there was a loud noise like a clap
of thunder, and the ground opened before them,
showing a great stone in which was a brass ring.</p>

<p>Aladdin was so frightened by these happenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
that he would have run away, but the stranger
caught him roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” he cried. “I have
brought you here to do a special thing for me, and if
you refuse you shall not escape alive. If, however,
you are obedient I will make you rich for life.”</p>

<p>“What do you wish of me?” asked Aladdin in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>“First lift this stone for me.”</p>

<p>Aladdin caught hold of the brass ring and tried to
lift the stone, but it was too heavy for him, and the
magician was obliged to help him. Together they
dragged away the stone and showed an opening
and a flight of stairs leading down into the earth.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the pretended uncle, “you must go
down these steps and they will bring you into a
palace divided into three halls. You will see in
these halls great chests filled with gold and silver,
but for your life do not touch them; do not even
brush against the walls or touch them either,
for if you do you will surely perish. Go straight
through the halls and you will come to a garden; it
is full of fruit-trees, and if you should wish to
gather some of the fruit you may safely do so; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
harm will come to you from so doing. At the
farthest side of the garden is a wall; in this wall is a
niche; in this niche is a small bronze lamp. Take it
and empty out the oil and bring it to me.”</p>

<p>Aladdin had no wish to descend the stairs into
the earth, but the stranger frightened him, and he
dared not refuse. He started down, but the magician
called him back. “Here! take this,” he said,
and slipping a ring from his finger he placed it
on Aladdin’s hand. “It will protect you from any
dangers you may meet with.”</p>

<p>Aladdin now went on down the stairs, and at the
foot of them he found the palace halls the stranger
had told him of. Everywhere he saw chests of
silver and gold, but he was careful to touch none
of them. He walked on very warily and out into
the garden. He found the lamp without any
trouble, emptied out the oil, and thrust it into the
sash that was twisted about his waist.</p>

<p>All about him were fruit-trees loaded with the
most beautiful fruits he had ever seen. They were
of all colors, and shone as though polished. Aladdin
picked some of them, but instead of being
juicy and delicious as he had expected, they were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
hard he could neither bite nor break them. They
seemed indeed to be made of glass, only much
harder and brighter; they were so pretty the boy
gathered a great quantity of them; he filled his
pockets and sleeves and shirt with the fruit and
then hurried back through the hall and up the steps.
He saw his pretended uncle stooping over and
watching for him impatiently.</p>

<p>“Did you get the lamp?” cried the magician
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have it here.”</p>

<p>The magician’s eyes sparkled with triumph. He
reached down his hand. “Give it to me, quick,
quick!” he cried.</p>

<p>“In a moment,” said Aladdin; “but my hands
are full of fruit and it is in my waistband. First
help me out, and then I will give it to you.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Give it to me now,” cried the magician
sharply. He did not, indeed, intend to let
Aladdin ever come out alive. He meant as soon
as he had the lamp to push the stone back into
place and fasten the lad in.</p>

<p>Aladdin did not guess this, but for some reason
he felt suddenly afraid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot give you the lamp,” he cried, “until
you let me out.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Not until you let me out.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the magician flew into a black rage.
“Then stay where you are,” he cried fiercely.</p>

<p>He threw another pinch of powder into the fire
which was still burning, and muttered a magic
charm. At once the stone rose and dropped back
into its place, and Aladdin found himself shut in,
in darkness.</p>

<p>Filled with terror, he beat upon the stone, and
called to the magician to let him out. But there
was no answer. He put his shoulders under the
stone and tried to lift it, but it would not stir. Aladdin
sat down and wept bitter tears. He felt he was
a prisoner forever. Suddenly he remembered the
garden. Perhaps he could find some way out
through it.</p>

<p>He made his way slowly down the steps, feeling
his way through the darkness. As he did this he
happened to rub the magician’s ring against the
wall.</p>

<p>At once a horrible genie appeared before him, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
black as pitch, but with eyes that shone like a red
fire, and lightened up the darkness.</p>

<p>“What wouldst thou have?” asked this terrible
being. “I and the other slaves of the ring upon thy
finger stand ready to serve thee.”</p>

<p>Aladdin was astonished beyond measure, but he
made shift to say, “If you are able, take me away
from here and back to my mother’s house.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” answered the genie.</p>

<p>At once Aladdin felt himself caught up and
carried through the air swifter than the wind, and
almost before he could draw breath he was back
in his mother’s house, and the genie had disappeared.</p>

<p>His mother could hardly believe her eyes when
Aladdin appeared so suddenly before her.</p>

<p>“My dear son, where did you come from, and
where is your uncle?” she asked.</p>

<p>As soon as Aladdin could get his breath he told
her the whole story. His mother listened and
wondered. “Without doubt,” said she, “this
man is not your uncle at all, but a magician who
wished to use you for some wicked purpose.”</p>

<p>To this Aladdin agreed, but he was so hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
that he begged his mother to get him something to
eat before they talked further.</p>

<p>His mother began to weep. “Alas!” said she,
“I have not a morsel of food in the house, and no
money with which to buy any.”</p>

<p>Aladdin remembered the lamp which was still in
his waist-band. He drew it out. “Look!” said
he. “This lamp must be worth something since
the magician was so anxious to have it. Take it to
some shop, or to one of the neighbors, and perhaps
they will pay you enough for it for us to buy some
rice.”</p>

<p>This seemed to the mother a wise plan. “I will
do as you say,” said she, “but first I will brighten
the lamp, for it is very black and dirty.”</p>

<p>She took some sand and water to polish it, but
scarcely had she begun to rub it when a genie, even
more terrible looking than the genie of the ring,
appeared before them.</p>

<p>“What dost thou wish?” he asked in a voice of
thunder. “I and the other slaves of the lamp
stand ready to serve thee in all things.”</p>

<p>The widow was so terrified at the sight of the
genie, and at the sound of his voice, that she fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
down on her face and lay there. But Aladdin
caught the lamp from her hand.</p>

<p>“If you would serve me bring us something to
eat,” he cried.</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” answered the genie. At
once he disappeared, but scarcely was he gone
before he appeared again with a great silver tray
and a number of silver dishes and cups full of all
sorts of delicious things to eat and drink. The
genie set it upon a table. “Hast thou any further
commands?” he asked in a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>“Not at present,” answered Aladdin.</p>

<p>At once the genie disappeared.</p>

<p>Aladdin called to his mother, and when she
looked up and saw the genie had gone she was able
to raise herself from the floor, though she still
shook and trembled. She and her son sat down
and ate and drank to their hearts’ content, and
there was enough food left over to serve them
another day. Aladdin then took the silver tray
and the dishes out to a merchant he knew and
sold them for a good price; so in this way he had
money to spend.</p>

<p>After this Aladdin and his mother lived very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
comfortably. Whenever they were hungry Aladdin
had only to rub the lamp and command the genie
to bring them food, and it was served to them
immediately. It was always brought to them in
silver dishes and upon a silver tray, and as Aladdin
could sell these for a good price he and his mother
lacked for nothing.</p>

<p>Aladdin now began to go about among the merchants
of the city and talk with them, and before
long he learned to his surprise that the fruits he
had brought with him from the garden were not
glass at all, but jewels, and jewels so rare and
magnificent that they were not to be equaled
anywhere.</p>

<p>Now the Sultan of that country had one daughter,
the Princess Buddir al Baddoor, and she was
the most beautiful princess in the world.</p>

<p>No man was ever allowed to see her face.
When she rode through the city to the public
baths the Sultan commanded that all the houses
should be closed and that the people should stay
indoors and not look out, upon pain of death.</p>

<p>Now Aladdin was very curious, as well as bold.
One day when the Princess was to pass through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the city he hid himself near the door of the baths
without anyone knowing it.</p>

<p>The Princess came riding down the street with
all her guards and ladies-in-waiting about her, and
just as she reached the door near which Aladdin
was hiding she dropped her veil, and he saw her
face. At once he was filled with a violent love for
her. It seemed to him he could not live unless he
could have the Princess for a wife.</p>

<p>When he returned home his mother noticed
that he was very thoughtful. She did not know
what had happened to him. At last she asked,
“My son, what ails you? Why are you so thoughtful
and silent.”</p>

<p>“My mother,” answered Aladdin, “I have seen
the Princess Buddir al Baddoor, and unless I can
marry her I no longer wish to live.”</p>

<p>When the widow heard these words she thought
her son must be crazy.</p>

<p>“How can you think of such a thing?” she cried.
“Have you forgotten that your father was nothing
but a tailor? How can a tailor’s son hope to marry
a princess?”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless that is what I intend to do,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Aladdin. He then urged and entreated his mother
to go to the palace and ask the Sultan to give the
Princess to him. The widow was very loth to do
this, but she loved her son so tenderly that at last
she consented.</p>

<p>“But have you forgotten,” said she, “that no one
can come before the Sultan without bringing him a
present?”</p>

<p>“I have not forgotten,” said Aladdin, “and I
mean to send the Sultan such a gift as he has never
seen before.”</p>

<p>He then fetched from the cupboard a porcelain
dish, and he also brought out the fruits he had
brought from the garden. He arranged the fruits
in the dish in a pyramid according to their colors,
and when he had done this his mother was amazed
at their beauty. They shone so brightly that it
dazzled the eyes to look at them. “Now I will
tell you,” said Aladdin, “that these fruits are
jewels so rare and magnificent that not the greatest
ruler on earth has any that can equal them.”</p>

<p>The widow was amazed when she heard this.
She could hardly believe it, and it was with fear
and trembling that she set out at length for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Sultan’s palace. She carried the dish of jewels
with her, covered over with a fine napkin.</p>

<p>When she reached the palace she went into the
audience chamber with the rest of the crowd who
had come to bring their cases before the Sultan.
She sat down near the wall and stayed there all
day, but she found no chance to speak to the Sultan
or to offer her gift. And so it was day after day.
Every morning she came to the audience chamber
with the jewels, and every evening she returned
home without having spoken to him.</p>

<p>But it so chanced the Sultan noticed how she came
day after day with the covered dish in her hands,
and he grew curious as to who she was and what
she wanted. At last he spoke to his Grand Vizier
about her, and commanded that she should be
brought before him.</p>

<p>This was done, but the poor woman was so
frightened by the honor done her that she stood
there trembling and unable to say a word.</p>

<p>The Sultan saw her terror and spoke to her
gently. “My good woman,” said he, “do not be
afraid. Tell me why you have come here day after
day. Is there something you wish to ask of me?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is indeed something that I wish to ask,
and yet I dare not,” said the widow.</p>

<p>The Sultan, however, encouraged her. “Speak,”
said he. “Do not be afraid. Tell me what you
wish.”</p>

<p>“My son,” said the widow, “wishes to marry
the Princess Buddir al Baddoor, and I have come
here to ask you to give her to him as a wife; and
my son also sends this small present, which he begs
you to accept.”</p>

<p>When this widow, so poor and meanly dressed,
said that her son wished to marry the Princess the
Sultan could hardly keep from laughing; but when
she uncovered the dish of jewels he was amazed.
He took up one after another and examined it with
admiration. He turned to the Vizier, who stood
beside him: “Never in all my life before,” said he,
“have I seen such beautiful jewels. Truly a man
who can send me such a gift as this is worthy to
have a princess for a wife. Do you not agree with
me?”</p>

<p>When the Grand Vizier heard this he was
troubled. He had indeed hoped that his own son
might marry the Princess. Now he said, “Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Majesty, these jewels are indeed very wonderful;
but we know nothing of the man who sent them.
He may be only some beggarly rogue who has
stolen them.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said the Sultan. He thought for
a moment, still turning the jewels with his fingers.
Then he said to the woman, “I am indeed very
much pleased with the gift your son has sent me.
Go back and tell him I am inclined to give him the
Princess for a wife, but first he must send me forty
basins of massy gold filled with the same sort of
jewels as these. If he can do this I will gladly have
him for a son-in-law.”</p>

<p>The widow returned home and told her son what
the Sultan had said. Aladdin was overjoyed when
he heard the message. He now felt sure that before
long he would be married to the Princess.
He took the lamp and rubbed it, and at once the
genie appeared.</p>

<p>“What dost thou wish?” asked the genie. “I
and the other slaves of the lamp are ready to serve
thee in all things.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Aladdin, “for forty basins of massy
gold, filled with jewels such as I gathered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
garden. I also wish for forty black slaves, magnificently
dressed, to carry the basins, and forty white
slaves, also magnificently dressed and mounted on
fine horses, to ride before them and behind.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” answered the genie.</p>

<p>At once he disappeared, but almost in a moment
of time a long procession of slaves appeared in the
street where Aladdin lived and gathered before his
house. There were forty black slaves, magnificently
dressed, and each bearing on his head a
golden basin filled with jewels even more magnificent
than those Aladdin had gathered for himself,
and there were also forty white slaves,
mounted on horses, to ride before them and
behind.</p>

<p>When Aladdin saw these slaves and the jewels
they bore his eyes sparkled with joy. He at once
commanded them to march to the palace and present
the jewels to the Sultan, and the widow herself
hastened away, so as to reach the palace at the
same time that they did.</p>

<p>The slaves set out through the city; a great crowd
followed them, shouting and rejoicing, for never had
such a sight been seen there before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sultan heard the sound of huzzahing and
wondered what was the reason for it. But when
the slaves entered the palace bearing their basins
of jewels he himself was filled with wonder and
admiration. He turned to his Vizier. “Surely,”
said he, “anyone who can send me such a gift as
this is worthy of the Princess Buddir al Baddoor;”
and though the Vizier could hardly hide his envy
he was obliged to agree with his master.</p>

<p>When Aladdin heard that the Sultan had consented
to his marriage with the Princess he could
hardly contain his joy. He at once rubbed the
lamp, and when the genie appeared he commanded
him to bring him the most magnificent clothes,
such as were suitable for a Sultan’s son to wear,
also a handsome horse for him to ride upon, and a
troop of horsemen, handsomely dressed to ride
with him.</p>

<p>All this the genie did, and after Aladdin had
bathed in a scented bath, and had dressed himself
in his magnificent garments he was so handsome
and noble-looking that his old friends would not
have known him.</p>

<p>He rode away to the palace, and there the Sultan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
received him with the greatest respect and honor.
He would have married Aladdin to his daughter at
once, but this Aladdin did not wish.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty,” said he, “greatly as I long to
see the Princess Buddir al Baddoor I wish first to
provide a palace for us to live in when we are
married. For this purpose I beg of your Majesty
to give me a plot of ground where I can build
it.”</p>

<p>The Sultan was surprised and disappointed when
he heard this. He thought it would take years to
build a palace, and he could not understand how
Aladdin could want to wait that long before marrying
the Princess. However, he gave him the ground
he asked for.</p>

<p>Aladdin then returned home and rubbed the
lamp. At once the genie appeared before him, and
asked him what were his commands.</p>

<p>“I command you,” said Aladdin, “to build me
immediately a castle twice as handsome as that of
the Sultan. I wish it to be furnished throughout in
the most magnificent manner, and I also wish for
a proper number of servants and guards to take
charge of it. There must also be gardens around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
it with fountains and trees and flowers, and stables
full of handsome horses, and above all there must
be a treasure-house filled with gold and silver and
precious stones.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” answered the genie; and at
once he disappeared.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the Sultan awoke and
looked from the window, he could hardly believe his
eyes. He stared, and rubbed his eyes, and looked
again. There, upon the bare piece of ground he
had given to Aladdin, stood a great palace glittering
with gold and silver and precious stones. It was
far more magnificent than his own, and it had been
built in one single night.</p>

<p>The Sultan at once sent for Aladdin, and when
he came the Sultan made the tailor’s son sit beside
him, and talked with him as an equal. “My dear
Aladdin,” said he, “you are indeed a very wonderful
man, and it is only fitting that the most beautiful
princess in the world should be your wife, and you
shall be as dear to me as though you were my own
son.”</p>

<p>That very day Aladdin and the Princess were
married, and went to live in the magic palace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
as they loved each other dearly nothing could
equal their happiness. Aladdin felt so secure in his
good fortune that he never even thought of the
magician or wondered whether he might some day
come to claim the lamp.</p>

<p>The magician had indeed left China soon after
his adventure with Aladdin. He journeyed back
and forth over the earth in many places, and at
last in his wanderings he came again to the city
where he had met Aladdin. There he heard much
talk of how a poor lad had married the daughter of
the Sultan, and of the magnificent palace he had
built. The magician never thought that Aladdin
might be that poor lad, for he supposed he had
perished in the hidden garden.</p>

<p>At last the magician became curious to see the
palace that everyone was talking about, and he
hired a horse and rode out to where it stood. As
soon as he saw it he knew at once that it had been
built by the genie of the lamp. He hastened home
and got out his magic books, and from them
learned that Aladdin was still alive, and that it was
he who owned the palace and had become the
Sultan’s son-in-law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>When the magician learned this he was filled
with rage and at once began to plot and plan as to
how he could get the lamp for himself, and destroy
Aladdin.</p>

<p>In order to carry out this purpose he bought a
number of fine new lamps and disguised himself in
poor, mean clothing. He waited until one time
when Aladdin had gone hunting with the Sultan,
and then he started out through the city with his
tray of lamps, calling, “New lamps for old! New
lamps for old!”</p>

<p>Many people heard his cry and came hurrying
out of their houses with old broken lamps, and
offered them to the magician to exchange. He
took them willingly, and for all of these old lamps
he gave in return fine new ones. The people
thought he must be crazy. A great crowd followed
him, shouting and laughing.</p>

<p>At last the magician arrived in front of Aladdin’s
castle. The Princess was sitting in an upper room
with her attendants and yawning and feeling quite
dull, because Aladdin was away. When she heard
the noise and hubbub in the street she became
curious. She sent one of her women to find out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
what the noise was about. She hoped it might be
something amusing.</p>

<p>Presently the woman came back laughing.
“Fancy!” cried she. “It is an old man with a
tray of the most beautiful new lamps, and he is
trading them for old ones.”</p>

<p>The Princess was much amused at this idea.
“Where is that old blackened lamp that I have
seen your master have?” asked she. “Look
about and see if you can find it?”</p>

<p>Her woman began to search the palace, and at
last they found the magic lamp hidden away in a
corner of the treasure-room. They brought it to the
Princess, and she at once caused the magician to be
brought before her. “Here, old man,” said she,
laughing. “Here is an old lamp. Will you give
me a new one for it?”</p>

<p>When the magician saw the lamp he could hardly
hide his joy. “Gladly, madam,” he answered.
“Choose whichever of the lamps you will, and it
shall be yours.”</p>

<p>The Princess chose one that pleased her well,
and the magician took the old lamp and hurried
away with it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had he reached home than he shut
himself up alone in his room and rubbed the lamp.
At once the genie appeared.</p>

<p>“What do you wish?” cried he. “I and the
other slaves of the lamp stand ready to serve you.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” cried the magician in a terrible voice,
“that the palace of Aladdin and all that are in it
shall be carried away to Africa.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” answered the genie, and
immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>That evening the Sultan and Aladdin came home
from their hunt. They rode along together, talking
pleasantly, until they came within sight of the Sultan’s
palace. Suddenly the Sultan drew rein and
stared with blank surprise. The castle that Aladdin
had built in a single night was gone. Not a
sign of it was left.</p>

<p>“Your palace!” cried the Sultan. “Where is
your palace?”</p>

<p>Aladdin, too, stared thunderstruck. “I—I do
not know!” he faltered.</p>

<p>“You do not know?” cried the Sultan. “And
my daughter! Where is she?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” answered Aladdin again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sultan was filled with rage. “You do not
know!” he thundered. “Miserable wretch! was
your castle only the work of enchantment? Have
you carried off my daughter by your magic? Now unless
you bring her back at once you shall surely die.”</p>

<p>Aladdin was in despair. He begged the Sultan
to allow him forty days in which to search for the
Princess, and to this the Sultan at last consented.</p>

<p>Aladdin at once set out on the search, but he did
not know in which direction to go. He wandered
about from one place to another, without learning
anything about the fate of the Princess or his
palace.</p>

<p>At last one day he found himself in a rocky spot
beside the sea. In descending the rocks he slipped
and caught his hand on a sharp point, and in so doing
he rubbed the magician’s ring which he still wore,
but which he had forgotten.</p>

<p>At once the genie of the ring appeared before
him. “Master,” said he, “what wouldst thou
have? I and the other slaves of the ring stand
ready to serve thee.”</p>

<p>Aladdin was overjoyed to find that the ring still
kept its magic powers. “I wish,” said he, “that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
you would bring back my palace and the Princess,
or else take me where they are.”</p>

<p>“I cannot bring them back,” answered the slave
of the ring, “for they have been carried away by
the genie of the lamp, who is mightier than I, but
I can take you where they are.”</p>

<p>The slave of the ring then caught up Aladdin,
and in less time than it takes to tell he had carried
him to Africa and had set him down in the apartment
in the palace where the Princess was.</p>

<p>When the Princess saw Aladdin thus suddenly
appear before her she gave a cry of joy and threw
herself into his arms.</p>

<p>“The lamp!” cried Aladdin. “Where is the
lamp?” for he wished to protect himself against
the power of the magician.</p>

<p>“Alas,” cried the Princess, “I do not know
where it is. Already I feared that all our misfortunes
had come from my trading off that lamp
to a beggar.” She then told Aladdin the whole
story of how one had come offering new lamps for
old, and of how her women had hunted up the old
blackened lamp, and she had given it away for a
new one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>Aladdin at once guessed that the beggar must
have been the magician in disguise. “We will
never be safe,” said he, “until we have that lamp
in our possession again. Does the magician ever
come here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said the Princess; “he comes here
every day and wearies me with his pretty speeches.
He wishes me to marry him, but that I will never
do.”</p>

<p>“Now, listen,” said Aladdin. “The next time
the magician comes greet him pleasantly. Talk
to him for awhile, and then offer him a glass of
sherbet. In this sherbet you must first put a
powder that I will give you. It is a sleeping-powder.
After the magician drinks it he will fall into a deep
sleep. You must then at once call me. Together
we will search his clothing, for I feel sure he is
afraid to leave the lamp anywhere, and carries it
always about him. If we can once get hold of the
lamp all of our troubles are at an end.”</p>

<p>The Princess promised to do exactly as Aladdin
bade her, and then he gave her the powder, and hid
himself in a room near by.</p>

<p>Not long after this the magician came, as usual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to sit and talk with the Princess. She met him with
smiling looks, and was so pleasant and friendly
that the magician was delighted. He hoped the
Princess was beginning to love him and that before
long she would consent to be his wife.</p>

<p>Presently the Princess took up a glass of sherbet
in which she had already dissolved the powder.
“I thought you might be thirsty,” said she, “and
I prepared this sherbet for you; will you not drink
it?”</p>

<p>The magician thanked her, and taking the goblet
he drank the sherbet at one draught. Almost at
once his head dropped back on the cushions and
he sank in a deep sleep.</p>

<p>The Princess did not delay a moment in calling
Aladdin. He came in haste, and together they
searched the garments of the magician. It did
not take them long to find the lamp, which was
hidden in his vest.</p>

<p>Aladdin rubbed it, and the genie of the lamp
appeared before him.</p>

<p>“What dost thou wish?” he cried. “I and all
the other slaves of the lamp stand ready to obey
thee.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“First,” said Aladdin, “I wish this magician
carried away to the uttermost parts of the earth,
and I wish him never to be allowed to come within
a hundred miles of the lamp again. Secondly, I
wish my palace to be returned to the place from
which it was taken.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” answered the genie.</p>

<p>He disappeared with the magician, and as the
magician never was seen again he probably never
escaped from the ends of the earth.</p>

<p>As for the palace it and all that was in it were
returned to the place where it first stood, and the
Sultan was so delighted to see his daughter again
that he gladly forgave Aladdin. The tailor’s son
was raised to the greatest honors in the kingdom,
and upon the Sultan’s death he became Sultan, and
lived happy forever after with his beautiful wife,
Buddir al Baddoor.</p>

<h2>THE COBBLER AND THE FAIRIES</h2>


<p>There was once a cobbler who worked hard at
his trade, and yet never seemed to get on in the
world.</p>

<p>One evening he took his last piece of leather
and cut out a pair of shoes and laid the pieces
neatly on his bench, expecting to finish them in the
morning.</p>

<p>“There,” said he to his wife; “that is my last
piece of leather, and I will have no money to buy
more until those shoes are made and sold.”</p>

<p>The next morning he went to his shop early to
begin work. What was his surprise to find that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the night the pieces had been made up into a fine
pair of shoes. He took them up and examined
them, and there was not a fault to be found with
them. It was indeed much better work than the
cobbler could have done. Not even the king’s
shoemaker could have done better.</p>

<p>The cobbler set the shoes out where they could
be seen, and he soon had a customer for them.
This customer was a very rich man. “This is a
very fine pair of shoes,” said the rich man after he
had examined them. “I will take them, and you
may make me two more pairs.” He then paid the
cobbler well, and went away, carrying the shoes
with him.</p>

<p>The cobbler was ready to dance with joy. He
hurried out and bought more leather, and by
evening he had cut out two more pairs of shoes.
He left the pieces lying on the bench as before.</p>

<p>When he came to the shop the next morning, he
found both pairs finished and standing side by side
on the bench, and they were just as well made as
the other pair had been. The rich man was delighted
with them, and he brought a friend to the
shop with him, who also ordered two pairs of shoes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>So it went on. Soon the cobbler had all the
customers he could attend to, and they paid high
prices for his shoes, for they were better than
could be bought anywhere else.</p>

<p>But the cobbler puzzled and puzzled about who
was helping him. No matter how late he sat up,
nor how early he rose in the morning, he never saw
anyone, and he never heard a sound.</p>

<p>At last he determined he would watch all night
and find out who was doing the work. So when
his wife went off to bed he hid himself behind some
clothes that were hanging in the corner, and
stayed there as still as a mouse. No one would
have known there was anybody in the room. The
moon shone in at the window and all the house was
still.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw two little brown fairy-men
there in the room, but where they came from he
could not tell. It was cold winter weather, but
neither of them had on coats or shoes or trousers.
They picked up the pieces of leather and looked at
them, and then they sat down cross-legged and
began to work. They fitted and sewed and hammered,
so fast that in a short time all the shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
were done. The two little men set them in a row
on the bench, and nodded to each other as though
they were well pleased, and then they went as
they came, without a sound, and the cobbler could
not tell what had become of them.</p>

<p>The next day the cobbler told his wife all that
he had seen the night before. The two talked it
over for a long time.</p>

<p>“We ought to do something to show our gratitude
to the little men,” said his wife. “How
would it be if I made a little shirt and a suit for
each of them, and you can make them each a pair
of shoes.”</p>

<p>To this the cobbler agreed. He went out and
bought some fine cloth and cambric, and buttons
and also some soft thin leather.</p>

<p>Then his wife set to work and made two little
shirts and two little suits all complete, even to the
pockets and buttonholes, and the cobbler made
two tiny pairs of shoes. When all was finished,
they laid the clothes out on the bench, and that
night they left a light burning and hid themselves
in the corner behind the clothes, to see what
would happen. The clock ticked on, and suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
they saw the two little brown men there in the room,
moving quietly about, though how they had come
there neither the cobbler nor his wife knew.</p>

<p>The little men went to the bench where the
leather was generally laid out, and there, instead
of leather pieces were the two little suits of clothes
and the two little pairs of shoes. The brownies
took up the clothes piece by piece and examined
them; they held them up and turned them this
way and that. Last of all they put the clothes on,
and they fitted exactly. Then they began to
dance with glee, and to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“How fine we be, how fine we be!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now we never will work again!”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So singing they danced about over tables and
chairs and benches and so on out the door into
the night, and they never were seen again.</p>

<p>But the cobbler prospered, and in time became a
very rich man.</p>

<h2>CINDERELLA</h2>


<p>There was once a girl named Ella who was so
gentle and beautiful that everyone who knew her
loved her, except those who should have loved her
best, and those were her stepmother and her stepsisters.</p>

<p>Her own mother had died while she was quite
young, and then her father had married again.
This new wife had two daughters of her own, and
she wished them to have everything and Ella to
have nothing. The stepmother dressed her own
children in fine clothes, and they sat about and
did nothing all day, but Cinderella worked in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
kitchen and had nothing but rags to wear, and
because she often sat close to the ashes to warm
herself her sisters called her Cinderella.</p>

<p>Now the King and Queen of that country had
only one son, and they were very anxious for him
to marry, but he had never seen anyone whom he
wished to have for a bride. At last they determined
to give a great ball, and to ask to it all the
fairest ladies in the land. They hoped that among
them all the Prince might see someone whom he
would choose. All the grand people of the city were
invited, and Cinderella’s stepmother and her stepsisters
were asked with all the rest.</p>

<p>The stepsisters were very much excited over it.
They were both so handsome that they hoped one
of them might be chosen by the Prince. They had
often watched from the windows to see him riding
by, and he was so gay and gallant that anyone
might have been glad to marry him.</p>

<p>All sorts of fine things were bought for the sisters
to wear, satins and velvets and laces and jewels,
feathers for their hair, and glittering fans for them
to carry, and the stepmother’s dress was no less
fine than theirs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Cinderella sighed and sighed. “I wish I might
go to the ball, too, and see that handsome Prince
and all the lovely ladies,” she said.</p>

<p>“You!” cried the sisters, laughing. “A pretty
sight you would be at the ball; you with your rags
and your sooty hands.”</p>

<p>“Go scour your pots and pans,” cried the stepmother.
“That is all you are fit for, you cinder-wench.”</p>

<p>So Cinderella went back to her work, but as
she scrubbed and rubbed the tears ran down her
cheeks so fast she could hardly see.</p>

<p>The night of the ball the sisters dressed themselves
in all their finery and came into the kitchen
to show themselves to Cinderella; they hoped
to make her envious. They swept up and down
the room and spread their gowns and smiled and
ogled while Cinderella admired them. After they
tired of her admiration they and the stepmother
stepped into a fine coach and rolled gayly away to
the ball.</p>

<p>But Cinderella sat in a corner by the fire and
wept and wept.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as she wept, a little old woman in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
a high-pointed hat and buckled shoes appeared
in the kitchen, and where she came from no one
could have told. Her eyes shone and twinkled
like two stars, and she carried a wand in her
hand.</p>

<p>“Why are you so sad, my child,” she asked;
“and why do you weep so bitterly?”</p>

<p>Cinderella looked at her with wonder. “I am
weeping,” she said, “because my sisters have gone
to the ball without me, and because I wished to
go too.”</p>

<p>“Then dry your tears,” said the little old woman,
“I am your fairy godmother, and if you are a good
girl and do exactly as I say, there is nothing you
can wish for that you shall not have. Run to the
garden and fetch me a pumpkin; and let me see
the mousetrap; if there are six fine fat mice in it
they will be of use.”</p>

<p>Cinderella got out the mousetrap as she was
told, and there were exactly six mice in it. She
also hurried out to the garden and fetched the
biggest, roundest pumpkin she could find.</p>

<p>“That is well,” said the godmother. “And
now the rattrap.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Cinderella brought the trap and there was a rat
in it.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the godmother, “we are ready
to begin.”</p>

<p>She touched the pumpkin with her wand, and
at once it turned into a magnificent golden coach,
lined throughout with pale yellow satin; she
touched the mice and they became six handsome
sleek gray horses to draw the coach. She touched
the rat with her wand and he was turned into a
coachman in a livery of scarlet and gold lace. He
mounted to the box of the coach, and gathered up
the reins, and sat there, whip in hand, waiting.</p>

<p>“Footmen! Footmen!” cried the godmother
impatiently. “Where shall we get them!” Her
sharp eyes glanced this way and that, and presently,
in the crack of the wall, she espied two
lizards. “The very thing,” said she. A touch
of her wand and they were changed to footmen
with powdered wigs and cocked hats. They
sprang up and took their places behind the coach.
“And now,” said the fairy, “all is ready, and no
one has a finer coach in which to go to the ball.
Do you not agree with me?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Godmother, my rags! I could not go to
the ball in rags, no matter how fine my coach,”
cried Cinderella.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit! I have not done yet.” The godmother
touched Cinderella’s rags with her wand,
and at once they were changed to a gown of white
satin embroidered with pearls. There were diamonds
in her hair, and her clumsy shoes were
changed to glass slippers that exactly fitted her
little feet.</p>

<p>Cinderella wondered, and her heart was filled
with joy. The satin gleamed about her like moonshine,
and the diamonds shone as bright as the
tears she had shed.</p>

<p>“Now, my child, you can go to the ball,” said
the godmother. “But remember this: My fairy
charm can only last till twelve o’clock. At the
last stroke of twelve these fine clothes will change
into rags; the coach will again become a pumpkin,
the horses mice, and the coachman and footman
a rat and lizards as they were before; so
by twelve you must be home again.”</p>

<p>Cinderella promised to obey, and then she
stepped into the coach and rolled away to the ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>When she reached the palace the music was
sounding and the Prince was about to choose a
partner for the dance. All the ladies waited
anxiously, each hoping she would be the one to be
chosen. Many beauties were there, and it was
hard to say which was the loveliest. But when
Cinderella entered the room no one had eyes for
anyone but her. She was far fairer than the fairest,
as the crescent moon is lovelier than the stars.</p>

<p>The Prince came to her and took her by the hand.
“You shall be my partner in the dance,” said he,
“for never have I seen anyone as fair as you.”</p>

<p>From then on the Prince would dance with no one
but Cinderella, and none could wonder nor blame
him, for she was so beautiful that the heart melted
at sight of her.</p>

<p>The Prince begged her to tell him her name and
whence she came, but she would not, and when the
castle clock struck the quarter before twelve she
managed to slip away from him, and run out to her
coach. She sprang into it, the rat coachman
cracked his whip, and away they went, and the
Prince did not know what had become of her.</p>

<p>When the stepsisters came home, Cinderella was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a><br /><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
again sitting in the corner beside the fire, dressed
in her rags.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">

<div class="caption">CINDERELLA AT THE BALL</div>
</div>


<p>“Was it a beautiful ball?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a fine ball indeed,” said the sisters,
and they began to tell her about it.</p>

<p>“And whom did the Prince dance with?” asked
Cinderella.</p>

<p>“Oh, he danced with a strange princess who
came in just after the ball began. The Prince had
bowed to us and smiled, and he might have chosen
one of us as his partner, but after she came he had
eyes for no one else. She must be a very great
princess indeed, but no one could find out who she
was, not even the Prince himself, though he begged
and entreated her to tell him. She slipped away
before the ball was over, and no one knew where
she went. The Prince was like one distracted.
To-morrow night another ball is to be given, for
the Prince hopes the Princess may come again and
that he may find out who she is.”</p>

<p>Cinderella sighed. “Oh, my dear sisters, let
me go with you to-morrow, I beg of you. One of
your old dresses would do for me to wear.”</p>

<p>But the sisters laughed and jeered. “You the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
cinder-wench!” they cried. “No, no, the kitchen
is the place for you. We would die of shame if
any of those fine folk saw you.” Then they bade
her unfasten their dresses and help them to bed.
They must get to sleep and be fresh and handsome
for the second ball.</p>

<p>The next night the stepsisters dressed again,
and drove away to the ball, and more than ever did
Cinderella long to go with them.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they gone, however, when the fairy
godmother appeared in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “I suppose you would like to
go to this ball, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Godmother, if I only could!” cried
Cinderella.</p>

<p>The godmother bade Cinderella bring her the
pumpkin, the mice, the rat, and the lizards. Again
she changed them into the grand coach, the horses,
driver, and footmen, all complete. She then
touched Cinderella’s rags with her wand, and they
were changed into a dress even more beautiful
than the one she had worn the night before. She
stepped into the coach and rolled away to the
ball.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince had been watching for her impatiently,
and the moment she entered the room he
hurried forward and took her by the hand.</p>

<p>“Why did you leave me so suddenly?” he asked
her. “I sought you everywhere and could not
sleep all night for thinking of you.”</p>

<p>He then again led her to a place in the dance,
and he would dance with no one else.</p>

<p>As it drew on toward midnight Cinderella
became very uneasy. She tried to slip away without
being seen, but the Prince followed her everywhere
she went. At last she made some excuse
and sent him away for a moment. Then she drew
her cloak around her and sped down the stairs and
out to where her coach was waiting. She sprang
into it and rolled away. But half-way home she
heard the castle clock begin to strike the hour.
As the last stroke sounded the coach melted away
from around her, and a yellow pumpkin lay at her
feet; the horses changed into mice and ran away,
squealing; the coachman became a rat, and the
lizards made haste to hide in the crack of a wall.
Cinderella, in her rags, had barely time to run back
to the kitchen and take her place beside the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
before the door opened and her stepsisters swept
into the room.</p>

<p>“This ball was even more beautiful than the
other,” they cried. “And the Princess was there
again, and so lovely that it dazzled the eyes to look
at her. The Prince thought of no one but her.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if I could only see her!” sighed Cinderella.</p>

<p>“You the cinder-wench!” scoffed the sisters.
“Why she would not even allow you in her kitchen.
But come! Unfasten our dresses. To-morrow
there is to be another ball, and we must get to bed
and rest, so as to look our best.”</p>

<p>So Cinderella helped her sisters to undress, and
all the while she did so they could talk of nothing
but the unknown princess, of how beautiful she
was, and of how much the Prince had admired her.</p>

<p>The next night Cinderella helped to dress her
sisters and make them ready for the ball. They
rolled away in their coach, and then Cinderella
waited impatiently for her godmother to come. It
was not long before the old fairy appeared.</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “and do you wish to go to
this ball also?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Godmother!” cried Cinderella. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
wish to go as I never wished for anything in all my
life before.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then you shall go,” said the godmother.
“But do not forget, you must leave
before the clock strikes twelve, or your fine clothes
will turn to rags before them all, and your sisters
will know you as the cinder-wench.”</p>

<p>Cinderella promised, and the godmother then
touched her with her wand, and the rags were
turned into a dress even more magnificent than
before. If before Cinderella had appeared like
the crescent moon, now she shone like the moon in
its full glory. When she entered the ballroom
she appeared so beautiful that it dazzled the eyes
to look at her. The Prince followed her everywhere
and begged and entreated her to tell him
who she was, but she would not. Again and
again they danced together, and Cinderella was so
happy she quite forgot to notice how fast the time
was going.</p>

<p>Suddenly the castle clock began to strike.
Cinderella gave a cry of terror. She snatched her
hand from the Prince and fled away so fast that for
a moment he lost sight of her. Such was her haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
that as she ran down the stairs she lost one of her
little glass shoes, but she dared not wait to pick it
up.</p>

<p>Just as she reached the door the last stroke
of twelve sounded. Immediately her beautiful
clothes fell into rags; her jewels melted away, and
the guard who was on watch saw no one but a
little kitchen-wench who ran past him, weeping
bitterly, and wringing her hands.</p>

<p>Cinderella ran all the way home, and she scarcely
had time to take her place beside the fire before
her sisters swept into the room.</p>

<p>“What! crying?” they said. “Why are you
not content? You have a warm corner to sit in,
and no need to bother your head about anything.
But you should have seen the ball to-night. It
was more wonderful than either of the others;
and as for the Princess, she was so beautiful that
there never was anything like it. The Prince
never looked at anyone else. But she went away
as before, and no one knows where she went.
However, the Prince picked up one of her slippers
on the stairs, and he may find her by that.”</p>

<p>The next day the Prince sent out a proclamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
far and wide that he had found a glass slipper and
whoever could wear that slipper should be his
bride. He hoped in this way to find the lovely
Princess who had three times escaped him.</p>

<p>The slipper was sent around from one house to
another, and every lady was eager to try it on.
All hoped to be able to wear it, but it fitted none of
them. Some feet were too long, and some too
broad, some too fat, and some too thin.</p>

<p>At last the messenger came to the house where
Cinderella and her stepsisters lived. The stepsisters
could hardly wait to try the slipper on.
Each was sure she could wear it, and they began
to quarrel as to which should try it first. At last
it was given to the eldest sister. She sat down
and tried to put her foot into it, but she could
not. The toes went in easily enough, but her heel
would not go down into it. Then the second
sister tried it, but that was even worse, for she
could not even get her toes into it. The stepmother
stood by, begging and urging them to try
again.</p>

<p>But the messenger shook his head. “No, no,”
he said. “Neither of those two is the right one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
But is there no one else in the house who could try
it on?”</p>

<p>No, there was no one except the little kitchen-maid,
and it was not worth while for her to try it.
If the sisters could not wear it she certainly could
not. Nevertheless, the messenger said he must
see her. His orders were that everyone in the
city should try it on.</p>

<p>Very reluctantly the stepmother sent for Cinderella.
She came at once, and so modest and lovely
were her looks that the messenger wondered that
she should be a kitchen-wench.</p>

<p>She sat down and took the slipper from the
messenger, and put it on, and it fitted exactly.
Then she drew the other slipper out from beneath
her rags and put it upon her other foot, and at once
the messenger knew she must be the one the
Prince had been seeking.</p>

<p>He kneeled before her and said, “You are my
mistress, for you are the one the Prince has chosen
for his bride.”</p>

<p>The stepmother and the stepsisters were ready
to burst with rage and envy. They could not
believe their eyes, and would have sent Cinderella<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
back to the kitchen with harsh words and blows;
but this the messenger would not allow.</p>

<p>Cinderella was taken away to the palace and
dressed as a princess should be, and when the
Prince saw her again in all her beauty he was filled
with love and joy.</p>

<p>Soon after they were married, and though the
stepsisters were invited to the wedding they were
ashamed to come because their faces were so
swollen with weeping. As for the stepmother
she was quite ill with rage and spite, but the Prince
and Cinderella lived happy together forever after.</p>

<h2>JACK IN LUCK</h2>


<p>Jack had served his master well for seven long
years without having been paid a penny. At the
end of that time Jack went to him and said,
“Master, I have been with you seven years, and
now it is time for me to go home to see my mother.
But oughtn’t I to be paid something first?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his master, “you have served me
well, and you shall be well paid in return.”</p>

<p>He then brought out a lump of gold as big as
Jack’s head and gave it to the lad.</p>

<p>Jack thanked him and wrapped the gold up in
a handkerchief and tied the corners together, so
he could carry it. Then he said good-by to his
master, and off he set, whistling merrily. But the
way was long and the sun was hot. The further
Jack went the wearier he grew, and the gold
weighed as heavy as lead. He shifted it from hand
to hand, but every moment it became a heavier
burden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>After awhile Jack met a man riding merrily
along on a fine horse.</p>

<p>“That is a fine nag you are riding,” said
Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” answered the man.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a lucky fellow,” said Jack.
“There you ride along as light as a bird, and I
have to trudge in the dust and carry a lump of gold
that weighs like lead.”</p>

<p>“Is that gold you have tied up there?” asked
the man.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see a lump of gold as big as
that.”</p>

<p>Jack untied the handkerchief and showed the
gold to the man. When the man saw it his eyes
glittered and his mouth worked.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said he to Jack, “I am a good-natured
sort of a fellow. I am almost home and you have
still a long way to go. Give me the gold and you
shall have my horse in exchange, and then you can
ride along as proud as a king, and I will do the
trudging.”</p>

<p>That seemed to Jack a fine bargain. He thanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the man and gave him the gold, and then he
mounted the horse. The man put a switch in his
hand and said, “If he does not go along fast enough
just touch him with this and he will go faster.”
Then he tied up the gold in a great hurry, and made
off with it.</p>

<p>As for Jack he rode along holding his head high
and glancing about him. “How proud mother will
be to see me come riding up to the door like a
nobleman,” thought he. “How much better to
ride with my head in the air than to trudge along
in the dust.”</p>

<p>After awhile Jack thought he would like to go
faster, and he gave the horse a cut with the switch.
But the nag was a lively one. When it felt the
switch it kicked up its heels, and away it went,
jolting and bumping. Jack held on as long as he
could, and then he fell off into a ditch full of stinging
nettles. Luckily a man passing by stopped the
horse and brought it back to him. The man was
leading a cow by a rope.</p>

<p>“That was a nasty fall you had,” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jack. “Now I see that a horse
is a tricky animal. A man gave him to me for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
lump of gold I was carrying, and he seemed quiet
enough then.”</p>

<p>“A lump of gold?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“Yes, a lump of gold. How lucky you are to
have a nice quiet animal like the cow to give you
good milk and butter and cheese, instead of a
horse that runs away and throws you off.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am lucky,” said the man. Then he
thought a bit. “Listen,” said he. “I have had so
much butter and cheese and cream that I am tired
of them. If you like you shall have my cow and I
will take your horse, and you will have the best of
the bargain.”</p>

<p>“That I will,” cried Jack joyfully, “and I thank
you kindly for speaking of it.” He then gave the
horse to the man, and the man gave him the cow.
Then the man sprang upon the horse and away he
rode in haste without once turning to look behind
him.</p>

<p>Jack led the cow along by the rope, and his heart
was light if his heels were not. “Now I can live
like a king,” said he. “When I am thirsty all I
have to do is to milk the cow and have a drink of
fine fresh milk; and when I have a piece of bread—it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
is easy enough to get a piece of bread—I can
always have some butter with it, or a tasty bit of
cheese.”</p>

<p>The sun was high in the sky by now, and it shone
so hot that Jack’s mouth grew as dry as a nutmeg
grater. “Now is the time for a glass of milk,”
said he. He tied the cow to a post, and then he
sat down and tried to milk her; but he had never
learned how to milk, and not a drop could he get.
Moreover he was so awkward about it that at last
the cow gave him a kick that sent him head over
heels across the road. Jack got up and rubbed his
head. “That is a very dangerous animal,” said
he, “or else she does not like me.”</p>

<p>Just then a butcher came by, wheeling a fine
little pig in a barrow, and he stopped to speak with
Jack. “What ails you,” said he, “that you look
so sad and down in the mouth?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jack, “my cow has kicked me and
will not give me a drop of milk,” and he told the
butcher the whole story, how he had exchanged the
gold for a horse, and the horse for a cow.</p>

<p>“You made a bad bargain,” said the butcher.
“That cow is old and will never give milk. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
is nothing to do with her but to knock her on the
head and use her for beef.”</p>

<p>“How could I do that?” asked Jack. “And
besides I do not like beef. If she were only a fine
little pig, now! There is nothing I love better than
a tender juicy bit of pork.”</p>

<p>“Well, there now!” said the butcher. “I am
too kind-hearted for my own good, but if you like
I will take the cow and you shall have my pig in
exchange.”</p>

<p>Jack was delighted. He thanked the butcher
and took the pig in exchange for his cow, and off
he set, wheeling the pig before him, and he was
as happy as a lark.</p>

<p>After awhile he met a young man who carried a
fine fat white goose under his arm. Jack had
known the youth before, and they stopped to talk.
Jack told him all about his adventures, and what
fine bargains he had made.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is well,” said the youth. Then he
showed Jack his goose, and made him weigh it by
the wings and feel how fat it was, and how soft
were its feathers.</p>

<p>“It is a fine fowl,” said Jack. “But after all it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
is not as fine a creature as my fat pig, and it will not
taste as good when it is eaten, either.”</p>

<p>The youth looked the pig all over, and scratched
his head. “I do not know about that pig,” said he.
“A man just over there beyond the hill had his pig
stolen two days ago. I misdoubt me but what this
may be the very one. I only hope you may not get
taken up and put in prison for having it.”</p>

<p>“In prison,” cried Jack in alarm. “But I cannot
go to prison. My mother is looking for me
home, and it would break her heart if I did not
come.”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” said the youth; “I know the
ways about here better than you do. If you like I
will take the pig and give you my goose in exchange.
I may suffer for it, but if anyone is taken
to prison at least it will not be you.”</p>

<p>Jack thanked him with tears in his eyes. He
gave him the pig and took the goose and went on
his way rejoicing. “After all,” thought he, “I
would rather have a goose than a pig. Not only is
it good to eat, but it may lay me a fine big egg, and
its feathers will do to make a soft pillow for mother
to lay her head on.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>So thinking he trudged along with the goose
under his arm, and after awhile he came to a
village, and there was a knife-grinder turning his
wheel and sharpening knives and scissors for
people.</p>

<p>He worked so quickly and sang so merrily as he
worked that Jack stopped to watch him.</p>

<p>“That is a fine trade of yours—that of a knife-grinder,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” answered the man. “People are
glad to see me come, and they save their knives and
scissors for me to sharpen. I always can earn a
bit of money, and when I am tired of one place I
take my wheel and go on to the next. But that
is a fine goose you have. Where did you buy
it?”</p>

<p>“I did not buy it, I got it in exchange for a pig.”</p>

<p>“And where did you get the pig?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I took it in exchange for a cow.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the cow?”</p>

<p>“I got it in exchange for a horse.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the horse?”</p>

<p>“I bought it for a lump of gold as big as my
head.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where did you get the gold?”</p>

<p>“My master gave it to me in payment for seven
years’ service, but the gold was too heavy, and the
horse ran away, and the cow would give no milk,
and the pig had been stolen, but this is a very
fine goose, so you see I have been lucky in the
end.”</p>

<p>“That you have,” said the knife-grinder. “But
after all I would rather own this grindstone of
mine than the very finest, fattest goose. The goose
is eaten and that is the end of it, but this grindstone
always earns me a bit of money to jingle in
my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true,” said Jack. “I wish I had a
grindstone.”</p>

<p>The knife-grinder looked thoughtful. “It might
be managed,” said he. “I have another grindstone
that is a bit damaged, but works all right.
If you like you can have it in exchange for your
goose, and once you have a grindstone the rest of
the business is easy enough.”</p>

<p>“I am in luck indeed,” said Jack. “I have only
to wish for a thing and I get it. Here, take the
goose, and give me the grindstone.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>The man gave Jack an old cracked grindstone.
Then he picked up a heavy stone that lay by the
roadside. “Take this with you, too,” he said.
“It will be useful to you if you ever have a
crooked nail to straighten. Then you will only
have to lay it on the grindstone and beat it with
this rock, and you can straighten it out in no
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that will be a fine thing,” said Jack, and
he took the grindstone and the rock and thanked
the man and went on his way.</p>

<p>But the road was rough and the sun was hot, and
before long Jack was so weary with the weight he
carried that he could hardly drag one foot after
another, and the sweat poured down from his
forehead.</p>

<p>After awhile he came to a place where a well of
water bubbled up clear and fresh and cool. Jack
put his stones down on the edge of it and stooped
over to drink, but as he rose up again he happened
to give the stones a push, and plunk! they both fell
into the well and sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>“Now thanks be to heaven!” cried Jack. “If
I had had to carry those stones much farther my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
back would surely have broken. Oh, what a lucky
fellow I am! Everything I touch turns to luck.”</p>

<p>Then he started off with a light heart and light
heels, and it did not take him long to reach his
mother’s house.</p>

<h2>PUSS IN BOOTS</h2>


<p>A miller died, leaving three sons to divide his
fortune among them. The eldest took the mill
and the land around it; the second took the flocks
and herds, and then there was nothing left for the
third son, Jack, but three bits of silver money,
and a little cat that lived in the mill.</p>

<p>“This is all very well,” said Jack, “and the cat is
a fine little cat and can feed on the mice it catches,
but I do not see how I am to live on three pieces of
money.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” answered his brothers, “you will have
to start out in the world and do the best you can
for yourself.”</p>

<p>Jack took the little cat and started out.</p>

<p>“Do not be uneasy, master,” said the little cat.
“You have three silver pieces. Take them and
buy me a little pair of boots and a bag, and I will
make your fortune for you.”</p>

<p>Jack did not like to spend his money on a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
boots for a cat, but he knew he was a wise little
animal, so he did as he said. He went to a tailor,
and for the three pieces of silver the tailor made
him the prettiest pair of little boots that ever were
seen, and when Puss drew them on they fitted
exactly. The tailor also gave Jack an old bag that
lay in the corner, and for which he had no use.</p>

<p>Puss led Jack off into the country, and then he
bade him sit down by the roadside and wait for his
return. The little cat ran off into a wood near by,
where there were a great many rabbit-holes, and
there he managed to catch two fine fat rabbits. He
put the rabbits in the bag and trotted away in his
neat little boots until he came to the King’s palace.
There he asked to see the King, and a cat in boots
was such a strange sight that he was at once brought
before his majesty.</p>

<p>The courtiers nudged each other and laughed
when the cat came into court, but Puss marched
up to the King and bowed low before him.</p>

<p>“Your Majesty, my master, the Marquis of
Carrabas, has sent you a present of these two fine
fat rabbits for your supper,” said he, and he took
out the rabbits and presented them to the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>The King was very much pleased. He ordered
a piece of money to be given to Puss, and bade
the little animal thank his master for the fine
present he had sent.</p>

<p>Puss ran back to where Jack was waiting, and
gave him the piece of money. “There,” he said.
“That is enough to pay for a bed and a supper at
the inn.”</p>

<p>The next day Puss set off for the forest again, and
this time it was a pair of fine fat partridges that
he caught and carried to the King. “They are sent
by my master, the Marquis of Carrabas,” said Puss.</p>

<p>Again the King sent his thanks to the Marquis,
and gave Puss a piece of money, which the little
cat carried back to his master, and it was enough
to buy Jack food and lodging.</p>

<p>So it went on day after day. Every day Puss
caught some fine game in the forest and took it to
the King with the compliments of the Marquis of
Carrabas, and every day the King thanked the cat
and gave him a piece of money. The King began
to wonder who the Marquis of Carrabas was and
where he lived. He began to think the Marquis
was a very generous fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>One day the King went out for a pleasure ride
with his daughter, and many of his court rode with
him.</p>

<p>Puss came in haste to his master. “Come
quick!” he cried. “We have done well enough so
far, but the time has now come when I will make
your fortune.”</p>

<p>The cat then led Jack to a river, where he knew
the King would pass before long. He then bade
Jack take off his clothes and hide them under a
rock, and then stand in the river up to his neck.</p>

<p>Jack did this, though the water was so cold it
made him shudder, and he did not know how Puss
was to make his fortune in this way.</p>

<p>Puss waited until he saw his master well in the
river, and then he ran to the road along which the
King was coming.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” he cried. “Oh, help! My master—the
noble Marquis of Carrabas! He will surely
drown.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the King, stopping
his coach, and the Princess and all the courtiers
listened.</p>

<p>“Oh, your Majesty!” cried the cat. “My noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
master! He was attacked by robbers and they
robbed him of everything and threw him in the
river, and unless he receives help he will surely
drown.”</p>

<p>The King was very much concerned. He at
once sent courtiers to draw Jack out from the river
and dress him in robes of velvet and satin and gold
lace.</p>

<p>Jack had never been so magnificently dressed
before, and he looked a fine fellow indeed when he
was brought to the King. His majesty was so
pleased with Jack’s looks that he made him get
into the coach and sit beside him, and the Princess
was even better pleased with him than her father.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little cat had hurried on far
ahead of the coaches.</p>

<p>Presently Puss came to a field where the harvesters
were harvesting the grain. Puss marched
up to them scowling fiercely and bristling out his
whiskers until he looked twice as big again. The
harvesters were frightened.</p>

<p>“Listen, men,” cried Puss. “The King will
soon come by this way with my master, the Marquis
of Carrabas riding beside him. If he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
ask you to whom this grain belongs, answer that it
belongs to the noble Marquis of Carrabas. If you
do not do this you shall be torn into pieces, and
the shreds thrown into the river.”</p>

<p>The harvesters were more frightened than ever.
They promised to do exactly as the cat bade them.</p>

<p>Then Puss ran on until he met a drover driving
a great herd of cattle. Him, too, he frightened
so that he promised if the King asked him to whom
the herd belonged, he would say to the noble Marquis
of Carrabas.</p>

<p>A little farther on the cat met a shepherd with
his sheep, and he also promised to say his flocks
belonged to the Marquis of Carrabas.</p>

<p>So it went on; it seemed as though everything
was to be claimed by the Marquis of Carrabas.</p>

<p>Now all these things really belonged to an ogre
who was very rich and fierce and strong and terrible,
and after awhile Puss came to the castle where the
ogre lived. The little cat was not afraid of ogres,
however. He made his way into the castle and
ran along into one room after another until he
came to where the ogre was sitting.</p>

<p>When the ogre saw the little cat in his fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
shiny, creaking boots he was so amused that he
laughed aloud. He had never seen such a sight
before.</p>

<p>“And where did you come from, my fine little
cat?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, from over the hills and far away.”</p>

<p>“And what do you want here?”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to see you because everyone
says you are the strongest and most wonderful ogre
in all the world.”</p>

<p>When the ogre heard that he was much pleased,
for he was very vain.</p>

<p>“Well, and now you have seen me, what do you
think of me?” he asked.</p>

<p>Oh, Puss thought he was a very wonderful ogre
indeed. And was it true that he had magic powers,
too?</p>

<p>Yes, the ogre had magic powers.</p>

<p>“Can you change yourself into animals if you
choose? A lion or an elephant for instance?”
asked Puss.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, that was easy enough.</p>

<p>“I should like to see you do that,” said the cat.</p>

<p>Well, the ogre was willing to oblige him. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a><br /><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
once he turned himself into a lion, for he really
had that power, and he was a very terrible looking
lion indeed. He roared and lashed his tail and
his mane bristled.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">

<div class="caption">THE OGRE CHANGES HIMSELF INTO A LION</div>
</div>

<p>Puss was so terrified that he sprang through the
window and scrambled up the roof, though he
almost slipped and fell on account of the boots.
There he sat spitting and trembling.</p>

<p>Then the ogre turned himself back into his own
shape, and he laughed and laughed. “Come
back, Puss,” he called, “I will not hurt you; but
now you see that everything they told you was
true.”</p>

<p>Puss came scrambling back into the room, and
he looked very meek and timid.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see it was all true,” he said. “But,
Mr. Ogre, could you turn yourself into a small
animal as well? That must be a great deal harder.
Could you turn yourself into a mouse?”</p>

<p>Yes, the ogre could do that, too, and at once he
turned himself into a mouse, and ran, scampering
gayly about the room. But he did not scamper
long. “Ps-s-s-t!” with a bound Puss caught
him and swallowed him down in a moment before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
he could even squeak, and that was the end of the
ogre.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King and the Princess and Jack
were rolling along together in the fine coach and
talking pleasantly together. The King was so
pleased with Jack’s talk that he told the coachman
to drive slowly, so they could have the more time
together.</p>

<p>Presently they came to the field of grain where
the harvesters were at work.</p>

<p>“That is a fine field of grain,” said the King;
and he leaned from the coach and called to the
harvesters to know to whom the grain belonged.</p>

<p>“To the noble Marquis of Carrabas!” answered
the harvesters.</p>

<p>The King turned to Jack. “My dear Marquis,
why did you not tell me it belonged to you?”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>Soon after they came to the drover. The King
admired the herd of cattle and asked the drover to
whom they belonged.</p>

<p>“To the noble Marquis of Carrabas,” answered
the drover.</p>

<p>The King turned to Jack, and complimented him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
upon his herds. He began to think the Marquis
must be very rich.</p>

<p>Then they came to the shepherd, and it was the
same thing; his flocks belonged to the Marquis
of Carrabas. In the forest the woodsmen said the
wood belonged to the Marquis. It seemed as
though the Marquis were richer than the King
himself.</p>

<p>At last they came to the ogre’s grand castle, and
the King asked Jack to whom it belonged. Before
Jack could answer the doors were thrown open,
and the little cat ran out into the road. “Welcome,
welcome, your majesty,” he cried. “Welcome to
the castle of the Marquis of Carrabas.”</p>

<p>“So this is where you live,” said the King.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is where I live,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>The cat invited them to alight and led the way
into a long dining-hall. There the servants had
prepared a magnificent feast, for now they, as well
as the castle and everything in it, belonged to
Jack.</p>

<p>The King and the Princess took their places
at the table, and Jack sat between them. They
ate and drank and feasted to their hearts’ content,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and the King had never tasted more delicious food,
and it was all served on golden plates far finer than
those he ate from in his own castle.</p>

<p>At the end of the feast the King turned to Jack
and said, “My dear Marquis, you must be a very
rich man.”</p>

<p>“I am so rich,” answered Jack, “that I really
do not know how much I have.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the King, “that you ought
to marry a princess, for no everyday girl would do
for you.”</p>

<p>Yes, Jack would like to marry a princess, but it
would have to be the right princess.</p>

<p>“Then how would my daughter do?” asked the
King.</p>

<p>At that Jack was ready to jump out of his skin
with joy, for the Princess was so sweet and pretty
that he loved her already. “Yes, she would do
better than anyone else in the world.” And the
Princess did not say nay.</p>

<p>So Jack went back with the King and the Princess
to his own palace, and then the Princess and Jack
were married, and lived happily ever after.</p>

<p>The little cat lived in the palace with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
always the softest cushion, and the warmest corner
by the fire were left for him.</p>

<p>As for Jack’s brothers, when they heard of the
good fortune that had come to Jack, and how he
had won a princess for a wife, they wished they had
kept Puss and given him the mill and the flocks
and herds.</p>

<h2>THE TOWN MUSICIANS</h2>


<p>A donkey had grown so old and feeble that he
was of no more use to his master.</p>

<p>One night he heard his master and mistress
talking together. “I wonder you still keep that
donkey,” said the woman; “he is of no use to you,
and you only waste your money buying food for
him.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” answered the man. “I would
do well to get rid of him. I might sell his hide to
the tanner.”</p>

<p>When the donkey heard this he knew it was
time for him to be going, if he wished to keep his
skin for his own use. He pushed the stable-door
open with his nose, and made off down the road
without saying good-by to anyone. “I may be
too weak to work,” said he, “but my voice is still
strong. I will go to the big city and become a
musician.”</p>

<p>He had not gone far when he saw an old hound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
lying beside the road and whining. “Well, old
Bellmouth,” said the donkey, “what ails you?
You seem to be in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Trouble indeed,” answered the hound. “I
have grown so old and stiff that I am no longer able
to run with the pack, so my master had no more use
for me. He drove me away and threw stones after
me. What is to become of me now I do not know.
If my master would not keep me I am sure no one
else will.”</p>

<p>“Do not trouble yourself over that,” said the
donkey. “I am going to the city to be a musician,
and if you like you shall come along and sing with
me. I know you have a fine voice, and we two
together may make our fortunes.”</p>

<p>The hound was pleased with this idea. He got
to his feet, and he and the donkey went on together
in company.</p>

<p>A little while after they came to where a cat sat
in the grass by the roadside, looking as sad and
doleful as a rainy day in fall.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with you, Whiskers?”
asked the donkey. “You look as though all the
cream were sour and all the rats were dead.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no cream for me nowadays,” said
the cat, “and though there are plenty of rats I am
too old to catch them. I am no longer quick and
active, and I would rather sit by the fire and purr.
For this reason my mistress has driven me out of
the house with a broom, and I have no place to
go. What would you advise me to do in such
a case?”</p>

<p>“Come with us,” said the donkey. “Brother
Bellmouth and I are going to the city to be musicians,
and if you choose to come along and join your
voice with ours we shall be glad to have you.”</p>

<p>The cat was delighted, and leaping out into the
road it trotted along beside the others.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a farmyard, and a cock
had flown up on the gate post. It stretched its neck
and crowed, and crowed again.</p>

<p>“Enough! Enough!” cried the donkey. “Do
you want to split our ears with your crowing?”</p>

<p>“I must crow while I can,” said the cock, “for
that is my business. Every morning I crow to wake
the men, and I also crow to tell what weather we
will have. But I heard the mistress say that company
was coming to-morrow and that she must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
make me into soup, so my crowing days are almost
over.”</p>

<p>“That is a bad business,” said the donkey.
“You had better come with us. We are going to
the city to become musicians, and such a voice as
yours would be a great help.”</p>

<p>The cock did not wait to be asked twice. He
flew down from the gatepost and flapped along
beside them, but this was tiresome, so the donkey
bade the cock fly up on to his back, and after that
Master Red-head rode along in comfort.</p>

<p>Presently it began to grow dark, and still the
musicians had not come within sight of the big city.
Instead they came to a deep wood, and after wandering
about in it for some time they grew so weary
that they decided to go no farther that night. The
donkey and the hound lay down under a large
tree, the cat climbed up to a crotch of the branches,
while the cock was not content to roost anywhere
but at the top of the tree.</p>

<p>He had not been sitting there long when he said,
“Brothers, I see a light not far off. There must
be a house there.”</p>

<p>“That is good news,” said the donkey. “I for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
one have no liking for sleeping on the bare ground.
Perhaps if we go there and sing they may give us a
night’s lodging.”</p>

<p>This plan suited the others. The cat and the
cock came down from the tree, and the four musicians
set out together in the direction of the light.</p>

<p>It was not long before they came to a house and
the light the cock had seen shone through a lower
window. The donkey, being the largest, was
chosen to look in through the window and tell the
others what he saw.</p>

<p>The donkey looked so long and so silently that
the others grew impatient. “Well, Brother Greycoat,
what do you see?” asked the hound.</p>

<p>“Brothers,” said the donkey in a low voice, “I
can easily see that this house belongs to a band of
robbers. They have a quantity of treasure piled up
in one corner of the room, and they are sitting
around the table eating and drinking.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if we could only scare them away and take
the treasure for ourselves! Robbers are always
cowards,” said the dog.</p>

<p>The four companions consulted together and
laid out a plan for frightening the robbers away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
The donkey put his front feet up on the windowsill,
the dog mounted on his back, the cat mounted
on the dog’s back, and the cock flew up on to the
cat. Then at a certain signal they all began to sing
together. The donkey brayed, the dog howled,
the cat miaued, and the cock crowed. The noise
they made was terrible. The robbers jumped up
in a fright, and as soon as the animals saw they
were frightened they smashed the glass and
sprang into the room.</p>

<p>The robbers fled out of the door pell-mell and
into the woods without stopping to look behind
them.</p>

<p>“That was easily done,” said the donkey. The
animals then sat down at the table and ate and
drank to their hearts’ content. After that they put
out the lights, and then they settled down for the
night, each one in the most comfortable place it
could find. The donkey lay down on a heap of
straw outside, the dog curled up behind the door,
the cat settled down on the warm ashes, and the
cock flew up and perched on the rafters. Then
they all went to sleep.</p>

<p>Out in the forest the robbers wandered about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
for awhile, and then they all got together and
talked things over.</p>

<p>“We were very foolish to be so easily frightened,”
said the captain. “I have been listening
and watching, and everything is quiet around the
house and the lights are out. Let us go back there
and see if anyone is there.”</p>

<p>To this the others agreed. They crept back to
the house, and the captain sent one of the men
inside to see what was doing.</p>

<p>The man went in and looked about, and saw the
cat’s eyes shining in the dark. He thought they
were live coals, and as he needed a light he went up
and stuck a stick toward them, meaning to light it.</p>

<p>At once the cat sprang up with a yowl and
scratched his face. The man was terrified. He
ran to the door and the dog sprang out and bit him.
He tumbled out into the courtyard and the donkey
kicked him. The noise wakened the cock and it
stretched its neck and crowed “Cock-a-doodle-doo!”</p>

<p>The robber ran back to his captain trembling.
“Let us get away!” he cried. “A horrible witch
sits by the hearth, and she flew at me screaming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and bit and scratched me. A man back of the door
stuck a knife in my leg. Outside a hideous black
thing hit me with a club, and on the roof sits a
judge who cried, ‘Bring the rascal here!’”</p>

<p>The robbers waited to hear no more; they took
to their heels and ran away, and if they have not
stopped they must be running still.</p>

<p>But the four comrades found it so comfortable
in the robbers’ house that they stayed there and
enjoyed the robbers’ treasure, and never went to
the big city to become musicians after all.</p>
